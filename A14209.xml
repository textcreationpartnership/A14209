            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>EERE the ancient Towne of <hi>Lions,</hi> on that ſide where the Sunne ſets, there is a Countrey cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Forreſts,</hi> which in the ſmall circuite of it, contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth in it, what ſo euer is moſt rare in all <hi>Gaule,</hi> for being deuided into plaines and mountaines, the one and the other are ſo fertile, and ſituate in an ayre ſo temperate, that the ground is capable of all that which the Husbandman can deſire. About the hart of the Country is the moſt beautifull part of the plaine, compaſſed as with a ſtrong wall by mountaines neere enough, and watred with the riuer of <hi>Loyer,</hi> that taking his head not far from thence, paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth almoſt thorow the middeſt, yet neither violent nor muddy, but ſweet and peaceable. Many other riuers run there in diuers places, waſhing them with their cleere ſtreames: but one of the fayreſt is <hi>Lignon,</hi> which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring in his courſe, and doubting of his original, goes creeping thorow this plaine among the high mountaynes of <hi>Ceruieres</hi> and of <hi>Chalmaſet,</hi> as farre as <hi>Flens,</hi> where <hi>Loyer</hi> receiuing it, and cauſing it to loſe his name, carries it for tribute to the <hi>Ocean.</hi> Now on the banks of theſe pleaſant riuers, a man may ſee alwaies ſtore of ſhepheards, that what for the goodneſſe of the ayre,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:177519:5"/>
what for the fertility of the ſoyle and their owne ſweete nature, they liue in ſo great good fortune, that they take ſmall knowledge of fortune. And be aſſured that they need not enuy the contentment of the former age, if loue would as well haue ſuffered them to conſerue their felicity, as the heauens were truly prodigall vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but being aſleep in their repoſe, they ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelues to this flatterer, who ſhortly after turned his authority into tyranny. <hi>Celadon</hi> was one of them that felt it to the quicke, ouertaken in ſuch ſort with the perfections of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that the hatred that was betweene their parents, could not hinder him from loſing himſelfe wholy in her. And it is true, that if in the loſſe of himſelfe, a man may gaine any thing that may content him, he may call himſelfe happy, to bee ſo luckily loſt, to get the good will of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who hauing aſſurance of his loue, would not requite it with ingratitude, but rather with a mutuall affection, with which ſhe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned his loue and ſeruice. So that if you ſee any change betweene them afterwards, you are to thinke that the heauens permitted it, onely to manifeſt that there is nothing conſtant, but inconſtancy onely durable in her chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: For hauing liued happily enough, the ſpace of three yeeres, when they leaſt feared the miſchieuous accident that befel them, they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues caſt by the treaſons of <hi>Semire,</hi> into the profound miſfortunes of Loue; ſo that <hi>Celadon</hi> deſirous to hide his affection, to deceiue the importunity of their parents, who out of an ancient hatred betweene them, interrupted by what meanes they could their amorous deſignes, enforced himſelfe to make ſhew, that the accompt he had of this ſhepheardeſſe was rather ordinary then particular.

               <p>By fortune one day the amorous ſhepheard hauing riſen very early to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine his thoughts, leauing his flocks to freſh paſtures, went to ſit downe on the banke of the winding riuer of <hi>Lignon,</hi> waiting for the comming of the faire ſhepheardeſſe, who ſtayed not long after him: for being kept waking with an ouer-thoughtfull ſuſpition, ſhe had not cloſed her eyes all the night. By that time the Sun began to gild the tops of the mountaynes of <hi>Iſour</hi> and <hi>Marſellyes,</hi> the ſhepheard might perceiue from far, a flock which within a while he knew to belong to <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> for beſides that <hi>Melampe,</hi> the ſo belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued dog of his ſhepheardeſſe, came fawning on him as ſoone as it ſaw him, he noted that the ſheepe which his Miſtris made ſo much of, had not that morning the ribons of diuers colours which it was wont to weare on the head, in faſhion of a garland, becauſe the ſhepheardeſſe ouercharged with
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:177519:5"/>
deepe diſpleaſure, had not the leaſure to dreſſe it vp after her manner: ſhee followed after with a ſoft pace, &amp; as a man might iudge by her behauiour, ſhe had ſomewhat in her mind, that much rauiſhed her, and ſo intirely tooke vp her thoughts, that whether of neglect or otherwiſe, paſſing hard by the ſhepheard, ſhee caſt not her eyes to the place where hee was, and went to ſit downe farre enough from him, on the banke of the riuer. <hi>Celadon</hi> not much heeding it, ſuppoſed ſhe ſaw him not, or that ſhe went to ſeeke him where he was accuſtomed to attend her, hearding his flocks with his ſheep-hooke, draue towards her, who beeing ſet vnder an olde tree, her elbow reſting on her knees, and her hand ſuſtaining her head, ſeemed ſo penſiue, that if <hi>Celadon</hi> had not beene bewitched with his owne misfortune, he might eaſily haue perceiued, that this ſadneſſe could not grow, but from an opinion of the change of his loue, al other diſpleaſures being vnable to work ſo ſad &amp; pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue thoughts. But for that a misfortune vnexpected, is moſt difficult to be borne, I thinke, fortune purpoſed ſuddainely to aſſault him, that ſhe might robbe him of all meanes of reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Not knowing then the miſ-hap that was ſo neere, after he had made choyce of a commodious place for his ſheepe, neereſt to the flocke of his ſhepheardeſſe, he came to her to giue her the good morrow, full of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he had met with her: whom ſhe anſwered both with countenance and ſpeech ſo coldly, that the winter brings not with it more chilneſſe and froſt. The ſhepheard, that was not wont to ſee her in theſe tearmes, grew much aſtoniſhed at it, and though hee did not forecaſt the greatneſſe of his diſgrace, ſuch as he found afterwards; yet the doubt that hee had offended her whom he loued, ſo filled him with ſorrow, that the leaſt part of it was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to take away his life. But if the ſhepheardeſſe had vouchſafed to heare him, or if her iealous ſuſpition had ſuffered her to conſider, what a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine change the coldneſſe, of her anſwer cauſed in his countenance, out of queſtion, the knowledge of ſuch an effect had made her loſe all her miſtruſt: but it muſt not be, that <hi>Celadon</hi> prooue a Phoenix of good fortune, as he was of loue, nor that fortune doe him more fauour then other men, whom ſhee neuer leaues long in aſſurance of contentment. Hauing then ſtayed ſome while thus penſiue, at laſt hee came to himſelfe, and turning his eye toward his ſhepheardeſſe, he ſaw by hap that ſhee beheld him, but with a looke ſo ſad, that it left no kinde of comfort in his ſoule; ſo forgetfull had the doubt wherein he was, made him. They were ſo neere the riuer of <hi>Lignon,</hi> that the ſhepheard might haue touched it with his hooke, and the ſtreame held ſo ſtrong a courſe, that all glorious and charged with the ſpoyles of his bankes, hee deſcended very mainely into the <hi>Loyre.</hi> The place where
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177519:6"/>
they were ſet, was a piece of earth ſomewhat mounted, againſt which the fury of the water beat in vaine, ſuſtained in the bottome with a naked rock, but on the top couered with a little moſſe. From this place the ſhepheard ſtruck the riuer with his hooke, wherewith he raiſed not more drops of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then he found diuers ſorts of thoughts that aſſayled him, which daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him like water, were no ſooner come, then they were driuen away by others more violent. There was no one action of his life, nor one thought of his, that he called not into his minde, to enter into accompt with, and to know wherein hee had offended; but not being able to charge any one of them, his Loue conſtrained him to demand of her the cauſe of her anger. She that either ſaw not his actions, or if ſhee ſaw them, conſtrued them to the diſaduantage of the ſhepheard, went forward to fire his heart with a more burning deſpight, ſo that when he would haue opened his mouth, ſhe would not giue him leaſure to bring forth his firſt words, without interruption, ſaying, Is it not enough, perfidious and diſſoyall ſhepheard, to deceiue and coozen the party that deſerues it ſo little, but that going forward in thy vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſſe, thou ſtickeſt not to abuſe her that hath obliged thee to al faire courſes? How haue you the hardneſſe to come in my ſight, when you haue ſo much offended me? How dare you ſhew, without bluſhing, that diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling countenance, which hides a ſoule ſo double, and forſworne? Go, go, deceiue another, faithleſſe, be gone, and addreſſe thy ſelfe to ſome one, to whom thy perfidious dealings are vnknowne, and no longer thinke thou canſt diſguife thy ſelfe to me, that haue found too much, to my coſt, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thy vnfaithfulneſſe and treaſons. In what caſe this faithfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard was, he which hath truly loued may beſt iudge, if euer ſuch a reproch hath beene vniuſtly faſtned on him. Hee fell on his knees pale and gaſtly, like a man dead. Is this, faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid he) to try me, or to cauſe mee to deſpaire? Neither for the one nor other, ſaid ſhe, but for the truth, there being no neceſſity to try a thing ſo well knowne. Ah! ſaid the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, why haue I not put this vnlucky day out of my life? It had beene for the good of vs both (ſaid ſhee) that not one day, but all the dayes that I haue ſeene thee, had beene put out both of thine and mine. It is true, that thy actions haue made me hold my ſelfe diſcharged of one thing, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing done, diſpleaſes me more then thy vnfaithfulneſſe: That if the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that which is paſſed betweene vs (which I deſire for euer might be defaced) haue left mee any power; bee gone, diſſoyall, and haue a care I ſee thee not, vntill I command otherwiſe. <hi>Celadon</hi> would haue replyed, but loue, which vſually heareth readily enough, at this time, for his great hurt, had ſtopped his eares, and for that ſhe would haue beene gone, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned

to hold her by the garment, ſaying vnto her: I keepe you not back, to aske your pardon for the fault I know not of, but onely to make you ſee that it is the end I chooſe to put him out of the world, whom you make ſhew to haue in ſuch horror. But ſhe whom choler had tranſported, without turning her eyes to him, ſtruggled with that fury, that ſhe eſcaped from him, and left nothing but a ribon, on which by chance he had layd his hand. She was wont to weare it on her garment before, ſometimes to ſet out her part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let with, ſometimes to winde about flowers when the ſeaſon ſerued: at this time it had a ring at it which her father had giuen her. The ſorrowfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard ſeeing her depart in ſuch choler, ſtood a long time without moouing, not knowing what hee held in his hand, though he had his eyes on it. At laſt with a deepe ſigh, comming out of his penſiueneſſe, and knowing the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon: Be witneſſe, ſaid hee, O deare ſtring, that rather then I would breake one of the knots of my affection, I chooſe to loſe my life, to the end, that when I am dead, and that the cruell ſhall ſee thee about me, thou maiſt aſſure her, that there is nothing in the world can be better loued, then ſhe is of me, and a Louer worſe vnderſtood then I. And then faſtning it about his arme, and kiſſing the ring; And thou (ſaid he) the token of an intire and perfect amity, be content not to part from me at my death, to the end that this may remaine with me, at leaſt for a gage from her, who hath made me ſuch promiſe of affection. He had ſcarce ended theſe words, when turning his eyes toward <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> hee caſt himſelfe into the riuer with his armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſſe.</p>
               <p>In this place was <hi>Lignon</hi> very deepe, and the ſtreame ſtrong; for there was a world of waters, and the caſting back of the rocke made a kinde of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-mount, ſo that the ſhepheard was long before hee could ſinke to the bottome, and yet longer before hee could riſe vp; and when hee appeared, the firſt was a knee, and after an arme, and then ouer-whelmed ſuddaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the working of the waues, hee was carried farre off vnder the water.</p>
               <p>In the meane time was <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſet on the banke, &amp; ſeeing that which ſhe had ſo dearely loued, and which ſhe could not yet hate, ſo neer to death for her cauſe, was ſurpriſed with ſuch feare, that in ſtead of giuing helpe, ſhe fell into a ſwoune, &amp; ſo neere the brink, that at her firſt mouing which ſhe made when ſhee came to her ſelfe (which was long time after) ſhee fell into the water, with ſuch danger, that all that ſome ſhepheards that were there could doe, did but ſaue her: with the helpe of her clothes, which held her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the water, they had leaſure to draw her to the ſhoare, but ſo farre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides her ſelfe, that without any feeling of her part, they brought her to the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:177519:7"/>
next Lodge, which they found to belong to <hi>Phillis,</hi> where ſome of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions ſhifted her wet clothes, ſhee not beeing able to ſpeake, ſhee was ſo much diſmayed, both for the danger her ſelfe had runne into, and for the loſſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> who in the meane time was carried by the water with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that hee was driuen aland a farre off, on the other ſide of the riuer, among ſome little ſhrubs, but with ſmall ſigne of life.</p>
               <p>As ſoone as <hi>Phillis</hi> (who at that time was from home) knew the accident befalne her companion, ſhee ſet her ſelfe to runne with all her might; and had it not beene that <hi>Licidas</hi> met her, ſhe could not haue beene ſtayed by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other whoſoeuer he had beene: yet ſhe told him in few words, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into which <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had runne, not ſpeaking any thing of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe knew nothing of him. This ſhepheard was <hi>Celadons</hi> brother, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene whom the heauens had tied a knot more ſtraite then that of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: on the other ſide, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> beſides that they were couſin germanes, were ſo linked with ſo ſtraite an amity, that it well deſerues to be compared to that of the two brethren: that if <hi>Celadon</hi> had ſimpathy with <hi>Aſtrea, Licidas</hi> had no leſſe inclination to ſerue <hi>Phillis,</hi> nor <hi>Phillis</hi> to loue <hi>Licidas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By fortune at this time that they came in, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> opened her eyes, and they were very much changed from that they were wont to be, when victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Loue ſhewed it ſelfe triumphant ouer all thoſe which ſaw them, and which they ſaw, their looke was ſlow and abated, their lids heauy and ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and their brightneſſe turned into teares, but teares holding of a heart all inflamed, whence they came, and of thoſe eyes ſcorching as they paſſed by, which burnt vp both with loue and pitty all thoſe that were neere her: when ſhe perceiued her companion <hi>Phillis,</hi> it was a new cauſe of aſtoniſhment, and much more when ſhe ſaw <hi>Licidas:</hi> and though ſhee were vnwilling that they which were by, ſhould know the principall cauſe of her euill, yet was ſhe compelled to tell him, that his brother had endangered himſelfe while he ſought to helpe her. This ſhepheard at theſe newes was ſo amazed, that without longer ſtay he ran to the vnlucky place with all the ſhepheards, leauing <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> alone, who afterwards ſet themſelues to follow them, but ſo ſadly, that though they had much to ſay, yet were they not able to ſpeake. In the meane time the ſhepheards comming to the banke ſide, and caſting their eyes now this way, and after that way, found no ſhew of that they ſought for, except it were ſome that falling more low, found a great way off his hat, which the ſtreame of the water had driuen downe, and which by chance was ſtaied among ſome trees, which the waſhing of the riuer had looſened at the roote, and impaired. This was all the newes
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177519:7"/>
they could meete with of that they ſought; for hee was farre enough driuen away in a place where it was impoſſible for them to finde him, becauſe that before <hi>Aſtrea</hi> could be recouered of her ſwounding, <hi>Celadon,</hi> as I haue ſaid, driuen by the water, fell on the other ſhore among ſome trees, where hee might hardly be ſeene.</p>
               <p>And while he was thus betweene death and life, there came to that place three faire Nimphs, whoſe looſe hayre hung wauing on their ſhoulders, crowned with a garland of diuers pearles, they wore their boſome bare, and the ſleeues of their garments truſt vp to the elbow, from whence iſſued a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fine lawne, that gathered vp, ended toward the hand, where two great bracelets of pearle ſeemed to faſten it. Euery of them had at their ſide a quiuer full of arrowes, and bore in her hand a Bow of Iuory, the lower part of their garment before, turned vp behinde, that their gold-wrought buſkins were ſeene to the mid-legge. It ſeemed they came thither for ſome deſire; for one of them ſpake thus: This is the place, ſee heere the bending of the riuer: behold where it comes with violence from aboue, daſhing againſt the other ſhore, which breakes the force of it, and turnes it ſhort another way. Conſider this tuft of trees; without doubt, this is it which was ſhowne vnto vs in the glaſſe. It is true, ſaid the former, but there is no apparence of all the reſt, and mee thinke it a place ſomewhat too much with-drawne, to finde that which we come to ſeeke. And the third, which had not as yet ſpoke, There is, ſaid ſhe, apparence enough of that hee told, for as much as it repreſented this place ſo fully to you, that I doe not thinke there is a tree here, which you haue not ſeene in the glaſſe: with ſuch words they came ſo neere <hi>Celadon,</hi> that a few leaues onely hid him. And for that vpon particular marking of euery thing, they knew that without doubt this was the place that was ſhewed them, they agreed vpon deliberation, to ſee if the end would prooue as true as the beginning: but they no ſooner looked downe where to fit, but the principall among them ſpyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> and becauſe ſhe thought it to be a ſhepheard falne aſleepe, ſhee thruſt forth her hand euery way, ouer her companions: after, without ſpeaking a word, putting her fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger on her mouth, poynted with her other hand to that which ſhee ſaw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the little ſhrubs, and roſe as ſoftly as ſhee could, for feare of waking him: but ſeeing him ſomewhat neerer, ſhe tooke him to be dead, for he had yet his legges in the water, his right arme rayſed gently ouer his head, the left turned halfe behinde him, and as a prop vnder his body, the necke was wryed by the weight of the head, that let it ſelfe hang backward, the mouth halfe open, and almoſt full of ſand, dropped apace, the face in many places ſcratched and fullyed, his eyes halfe ſhut, and the haire (which he wore long)
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177519:8"/>
ſo wet, that the water ranne downe as from two fountaines along his cheekes, whoſe liue colour was ſo defaced, that a dead man lookes no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: the mid part of his reynes were ſo raſed, that they ſeemed to be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and that made his belly ſhew more ſwolue, though by reaſon of the fulneſſe of water, it was bigge enough of it ſelfe. The Nymphes ſeeing him in this plight, tooke pittie of him, and <hi>Leonide</hi> that ſpake firſt (as the moſt pittifull and carefull) was the firſt that layd hold on the body to draw it on ſhoare, when preſently the water which hee had ſwallowed, powred forth in ſuch abundance, that the Nymph finding him yet warme, was of opinion he might be ſaued. Then <hi>Galathea,</hi> who was the principall, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the other that ſtood looking on, but not offering any helpe; And you, <hi>Siluia,</hi> ſaid ſhe, what will my mynion ſay that you be ſo dainty? Lay your hand to the worke, if not to helpe your companion, yet at leaſt for pit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of this poore ſhepheard. I am buſied (ſaith ſhe) in confidering, that though he be much altered, yet me thinkes I ſhould know him: and then ſtooping downe, ſhe turned him on the other ſide, and looking neerer on him, Certainely (ſayd ſhe) I am not deceiued, this is the man I meant, and indeed he is worthy to finde ſuccour, for beſides that he is of one of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall Families of this Countrey, he is of ſuch deſert, that our labour ſhall be well beſtowed. In the meane time the water iſſued forth in ſuch plenty, that the ſhepheard being well lightned, began to breathe, yet neither opens his eyes, nor comes wholly to himſelfe. And becauſe <hi>Galathea</hi> was of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that this was hee of whom the Druide ſpake, ſhe began to helpe her companions, ſaying: They were beſt carry him into the Palace of <hi>Iſouer,</hi> where they might beſt ſuccour him. And ſo not without paine, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed him to the place where the little <hi>Merill</hi> wayted with the Coach: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the which all three hauing mounted, <hi>Leonide</hi> was ſhee that guided them; and leſt their prey might be eſpied by the warders of the Palace, ſhe went about to enter at a priuie gate.</p>
               <p>By that time that they were gone, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> comming out of her ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, where ſhe lay in the water, as I told you, while <hi>Licidas</hi> nor thoſe that went to ſeeke for <hi>Celadon,</hi> could heare other newes then that I ſpake of.

This ſhepheard ariuing, what with wearineſſe, what with deſire to know how this miſchance befell, ſate downe by her, and taking her by the hand, ſaid, O God, faire ſhepheardeſſe, what a miſhap haue we? I ſay we, for if I haue loſt a brother, you haue likewiſe loſt the man that was not ſo much his owne as yours. Whether it were that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> heeded ſome other thing, or that this ſpeech vexed her, ſhe made no manner of anſwer, whereat <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> being amazed, by way of reproach held on, Is it poſſible, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that the loſſe of this miſerable ſonne (for ſo ſhe called him) touches your ſoule no more to the quick, to make you accompany his death at leaſt with ſome teares? If he had not loued you, or his loue had beene vnknowne to you, it might be borne with, if we ſaw you haue no feeling of his euill: but ſince you cannot be ignorant of it, that he hath loued you more dearely then himſelfe, this is a cruell thing, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> beleeue me, to ſee you ſo little moued as if you knew it not.</p>
               <p>The ſhepheardeſſe then turning a ſad looke towards him, after ſhee had conſidered awhile, anſwered, Shepheard, I am ſorry for the death of thy brother, not for that he loued me, but becauſe he had other conditions which may make his loſſe worthy to bee lamented, for as for the loue you ſpeake of, it was ſo common to other ſhepheardeſſes my companions, that they are to take it as heauily as I. Ah vnthankfull ſhepheardeſſe (preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cried out <hi>Licidas)</hi> I ſhall hold the heauens to be partakers with thee, if they puniſh not this iniuſtice in thee. You haue ſmall reaſon to thinke him inconſtant, when the diſpleaſure of a father, the hatred of kindred, the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of your rigor, could not leſſen the leaſt part of that extreme affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which you cannot diſſemble to haue a thouſand, and a thouſand times acknowledged apparently in him. Truely this is a miſ-vnderſtanding, which ſurpaſſes the greateſt ingratitudes, ſince his actions and his ſeruices haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you no leſſe aſſurance of the thing, which no body but your ſelfe make doubt of. So (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> is there no body whom it concernes as it doth me. Out of queſtion it ſhould (replied the ſhepheard) ſince he was ſo thorowly yours, that I know not (and if he did I ſhould know) that he was more ready to diſobey the high God, then the leaſt of your deſires. Then the ſhepheardeſſe anſwered in choler, Let vs leaue this diſcourſe, <hi>Licidas,</hi> and thinke it cannot turne to your brothers benefit: but if he haue beguiled me, and left me, diſpleaſed that I no ſooner found out his deceits and craft, he is gone with a great ſpoyle, and faire markes of his vnfaithfulneſſe. You make me amazed, replied <hi>Licidas:</hi> wherein haue you found that which you reproach him with? Shepheard (added <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> the ſtory would be too long and grieuous; content your ſelfe if you know it not, you onely are in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:177519:9"/>
ignorance, and all along this riuer of <hi>Lignon,</hi> there is not a ſhepheard but can tell you, that <hi>Celadon</hi> loued in a thouſand places; and not to goe farre, yeſterday I heard with mine owne eares, the diſcourſe of loue which he had to his <hi>Aminthe,</hi> for ſo he called her, whereto I had made longer ſtay, but for ſhame: and to tell true, I had ſome buſineſſe elſe-where, that ſtood mee more vpon. Then <hi>Licidas,</hi> as one tranſported, cries out: I will no more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the cauſe of my brothers death, it is your iealouſie, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and iealouſie grounded on great reaſon, to be the cauſe of ſo great euill. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, <hi>Celadon,</hi> at this time I ſee well, thy prophecies fall out true of thy ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when thou ſaideſt this wench will put thee to ſo much paine, that it will coſt thee thy life: yet kneweſt thou not on which ſide this blow ſhould be giuen. Afterward addreſſing himſelfe to the ſhepheardeſſe: Is it credible (ſaid he) <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that this diſeaſe is ſo great, that it can make you forget the commandements which you haue ſo often enioyned him? I can witneſſe, that fiue or ſixe times, at the leaſt, he hath falne on his knees before you, to entreat you reuoke them. Doe you not remember, that when he came out of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was one of your firſt ordinances, and that within yonder bowre, where I ſaw you meete together ſo often, hee beſought you to award him death, much rather then to make ſhew to loue any other? <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> would he ſay (while I liue, I ſhall remember the very words) it is not for that I refuſe, but becauſe I am vnable to obſerue this iniunction, that I caſt my ſelfe at your feete, and beſeech you, that to make proofe what power you haue ouer me, you command me to die, rather then to ferue any other whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, but <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> And you anſwered him (my ſonne) I require this proofe of your loue, and not your death, which cannot be without mine owne: for beſides, I know it is moſt hard to you, yet will it bring vs a commodity, which we eſpecially are to looke after; which is, to ſhut vp both the eyes and mouthes of the moſt curious and reproachfull, whether hee oftentimes replied hereto, and whether hee made all the refuſall which the obedience (to which his affection bound him vnto you) might permit, I referre to your ſelfe, if you haue the minde to remember it: ſo farre am I from thinking he euer diſobeyed you, but for this onely cauſe, and in truth it was ſo heauy an impoſition, that at all times when he returned from the place, where he was enforced to diſſemble, he was compelled to take his bed, as if he came from ſome great piece of ſeruice, and there he would reſt himſelfe ſome while, and then he vndertooke it afreſh. But now <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> my brother is dead, ſo it is, whether you beleeue it, or not beleeue it, it will doe him neither good nor hurt, ſo that you are not to thinke that I ſpeake to you in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe, but onely for the truths ſake, yet may you credit me as you thinke

had almoſt put her beſide her ſelfe. So it was, that iealouſie, which as yet hel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And although ſhe well knew it was he, yet argued ſhe the contrary in her mind, following the cuſtome of many moe perſons, who will alwaies ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintaine a thing, as if it were their opinion. And much about that time came diuers ſhepheards from ſeeking <hi>Celadon,</hi> where they found no notice of him, but his hat, which was nothing to the ſad <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> but a freſh renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſorrow. And becauſe ſhe remembred her ſelfe of a ſleight which loue made them deuiſe, and ſhe was loth it ſhould be knowne, ſhe made ſigne to <hi>Phillis</hi> to take it; and then euery one betooke them to their lamentations and praiſes of the poore ſhepheard: and there was not any that repeated not ſome vertuous action, onely ſhe that felt moſt, was inforced to fit mute, and to make leſſe ſhew, knowing well, that the maine wiſedome in loue, is, to hold affection hidden, or at leaſt, not to diſcouer it vnprofitably.

them very curiouſly, although they were much ſhaddowed: but the cutting, which as yet was freſh, diſcouered them ſoon enough. O God, how ſoon ſhe found them to be <hi>Celadons,</hi> and how quickly ſhe ranne to reade them, but how to the quicke, did they touch her ſoule? She ſat downe on the ground, and laying in her lap the hat and letter of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe held ſome while, her hand claſped together, and her fingers locked one in another, holding her eyes vpon that which onely remained to her of her ſhepheard &amp; ſeeing that the hat was bigger about the place wherein he vſed to put his letters, when he would giue them her in ſecreſie, ſhe felt with her hand very curiouſly, and thruſting her fingers vnder the lining, ſhe found the bare felt: wherein looſening the butto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhe drew forth a paper, which that day <hi>Celadon</hi> had put in. This deuice they inuented betweene them, when the euill will of their Parents hindred them from talking together; for caſting this hat from one to the other in ſport, they might eaſily take and giue their letters. All trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſhe took this out of this pretty packet, &amp; cleane beſides her ſelf, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it abroad, ſhee caſt her eye on it to reade it, but ſhe had ſo ſcared the powers of her ſoule, that ſhe was forced diuers times to wipe her eies before ſhe could do it, in the end ſhe read theſe words:</p>

               <p>Oh! what cutting raſors were theſe words to her ſoule, when they brought into her memory the commandement which ſhe had giuen him, &amp; the reſolution which they had taken to hide by this diſſimulation their loue? But ſee what the bewitchings are of loue! ſhe rooke extreme diſpleaſure for the death of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and yet ſhe was not without ſome contentment in the midſt of ſo great ſorrow, knowing that in truth hee was not vnfaithful; and of which ſhee was aſſured, the many proofes whereof had cleered the cloudy miſt of her ielouſly: all theſe conſiderations ioyned themſelues toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to haue the more force to torment her in ſuch ſort, that not being able to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177519:11"/>
runne to other remedy then teares, as well to bewaile <hi>Celadon,</hi> as to weepe for her owne loſſe, ſhe gaue beginning to her griefe with a riuer of teares, and after, with a thouſand pittifull alaſſes, diſtempering the quiet of her ſtomake with infinite ſighes gaſping for life, and with vnpittifull hands beating her faire hands, ſhe called to remembrance the faithfull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which ſhe had formerly found in this ſhepheard, the extremitie of his affection, her deſpaire for hauing ſo readily thruſt from her the life of her repoſe: and then were repreſented the happy time of his ſeruice, the pleaſures and contentment which the honeſty of their deuices had wrought her, and what beginnings of ſorrow ſhe met with, ſince by his loſſe, which though ſhe found very great, yet did ſhe not iudge it equall to her folly, ſince the continuance of ſo many yeeres might haue giuen her aſſurance e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of his fidelitie.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Licidas,</hi> that was ſo little ſatisfied with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> not being able with patience to ſuffer this griefe, roſe vp hard by <hi>Phillis,</hi> but not to tell any thing of her companion, which diſpleaſed him, and went with a ſtomake ſo ſwolne, his eyes ſo filled with teares, and countenance ſo changed, that his ſhepheardeſſe ſeeing him in this plight, and giuing him ſome token of her loue, followed him without feare of what men might ſay of her. He went with his armes croſſe his breſt, his head hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe, his hat pull'd about his eares, but his ſoule more ouerwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with ſorrow. And becauſe the commiſeration of his euill bound the ſhepheardeſſe that loued him, to take part in his ſadneſſe, they followed him, and lamented behind him: but this pittifull office of theirs was but a renewing of his griefe. For extreme ſorrow hath this going with it, that ſolitarineſſe is his firſt garment, becauſe that in company the ſoule dares not freely diſgorge it ſelfe of the venome of the euill; and vntill that be vented, it is neuer capable of any remedy by conſolation. Being thus pai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by fortune they met a young ſhepheard lying along on the graſſe, and two ſhepheardeſſes with him: the one holding his head in her lappe, and the other playing on an Harpe, while he went breathing out theſe verſes, his eyes lifted vp to heauen, his hands layd on his breſt, and his face co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered with teares.</p>

                  <hi>Licidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> were very curious to know the griefe of this ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, if their own would haue giuen them leaue; but ſeeing he had as much need of conſolation as themſelues, they would not ioyne another mans euill to their owne, and ſo leauing the other ſhepheards attentiue to finde it out, they held on their way, no man following them: for the deſire euery one had to know what this vnknowne company might be, <hi>Licidas</hi> was not gone far, before they heard another voice ſome good way off, which ſeemed to come towards them, and they willing to harken, were hindred by the ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, who held the ſhepheards head in her lap, with theſe complaints: Well, thou cruell, well, ſhepheard without pitty, how long ſhall this obſtinate hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of thine indure againſt my prayers? How long haſt thou determined that I ſhould be diſdained and contemned for a thing that is not? and for the ſake of one dead, I ſhould bee depriued of that which cannot profit it? Conſider <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> conſider, thou Idolater of the dead, and enemy to the liuing; what the perfection of my loue is, and begin at laſt, begin to loue the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that liues, and not them that are dead, whom you muſt leaue in reſt to God, and not diſquiet their happy cinders with vnprofitable teares, and take heed, leſt in holding on thus, you draw not on you the vengeance of your cruelty and iniuſtice.</p>
               <p>The ſhepheard not turning his eyes to her, anſwered coldly, Would to God, faire ſhepheardeſſe, I might be ſuffered to giue you ſatisfaction with my death: for to free you and my ſelfe alſo of the payne wherein we are, I would chooſe it rather then my life: but ſince, as you haue told me, this were but to increaſe your griefe; I beſeech thee, <hi>Laonice,</hi> enter into thy ſelfe, and conſider how ſmall reaſon thou haſt, to make my deare <hi>Cleon</hi> dye twice. It is ſufficient (ſince my miſ-hap will haue it ſo) that ſhe hath once paid the tribute of her humanity; then, if after her death ſhe be reuiued in me by force of my loue, why (cruell) will you haue her dye againe, by the forgetfulneſſe which a new loue will cauſe in my ſoule? No, no, ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, your reproaches ſhall neuer haue ſuch power ouer me, to make me to conſent to ſo wicked a counſell, becauſe that which you call cruelty, I name faithfulneſſe; and that which you thinke worthy puniſhment, I iudge it to deſerue high commendation. I haue told you, that in my Tombe, the memory of my <hi>Cleon</hi> ſhall liue by my bones: that which I haue ſayd to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:177519:12"/>
you, I haue a thouſand times ſworne to the immortall gods, and to this faire ſoule which is now with them: and thinke you that they will ſuffer <hi>Tyrcis</hi> to goe vnpuniſhed, if forgetfull of his oath, he become vnfaithfull? Ah!

               <p>At theſe laſt verſes the ſhepheard was come ſo neere to <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> that he might diſcerne the teares of <hi>Laonice,</hi> and becauſe, though they were ſtrangers, yet they knew one the other; and to buſie them a while by the way, the ſhepheard knowing the ſorrow of <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> rowſed himſelfe to accoſt them in this manner: O deſolate ſhepheard (for by reaſon of this ſadde time of life, ſuch was the name that euery man gaue him) if I ſhould be like you, I ſhould thinke my ſelfe moſt vnhappy. <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> hearing him ſpeake, roſe vp to anſwer him. And I, <hi>Hylas,</hi> if I were in your place, how might you call me vnhappy? If I muſt lament (reioyned he) as you do for all the Miſtreſſes that I haue loſt, I ſhould haue cauſe to complaine longer then I haue to liue. If you do like me, anſwered <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> you ſhould lament but onely for one. If you do like me, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> you ſhould lament for none of them all. Heerein it is, ſayd the deſolate, that I account you miſerable: for if nothing can be the ſufficient price of Loue, but Loue, you were neuer loued of any, ſeeing you neuer loued any; and ſo you may trade in many loues, but not buy any, not hauing the money which is payed for ſuch a commoditie. But how know you (anſwered <hi>Hylas)</hi> that I neuer loued? I know it (ſaid <hi>Tyrcis)</hi> by your
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:177519:13"/>
perpetuall changes. We are (ſaid he) of a differing opinion; for I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, the more expert the workman is, the more he exerciſes the myſterie whereof he makes profeſſion. It is true, anſwered <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> when one fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the rules of Art, but when they do otherwiſe, it falleth out to them as to men out of their way, the further they go, the more they wander from it. Therefore it is, that as the ſtone that continually roules, gets no moſſe, but rather durt and filth; in like maner, your lightneſſe may gaine you ſhame, but neuer loue. You muſt know, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that the ſtripes of loue will neuer be healed. God keepe me (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> from any one ſuch ſtripe. You haue reaſon, replyed <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> for if euery time you are ſtrucke with a new beauty, you had receiued an incurable wound, I know not whether in all your body you had had a free place. But ſo you ſhould be depriued of thoſe ſweetes and happineſſes which loue brings to the true louers, and that miraculouſly (as all his other actions) by the ſame ſtroke that he gaue them, ſo that if the tongue were able to expreſſe that which the heart cannot entirely relliſh, and it were permitted you to heare the ſecrets of this god, I do not beleeue but you would willingly renounce your infidelity. Then <hi>Hylas</hi> ſmiling, Without faining (ſaid he) you haue reaſon, <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> to put your ſelfe into the number of them whom Loue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo kindely. As for me, if he vſe all others as he doth you, I will wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly forgoe my part, and let you enioy alone your felicities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, and feare not that I ſhall euer enuy you. It is aboue a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth ſince we ordinarily met together; tell me the day, the houre, or the moment, in which I could ſee your eyes without the wiſhed company of teares; and on the contrary, name me the day, the houre and moment, in which you heard me onely ſigh for my loues. Euery man that hath not his taſte peruerted, as you haue your iudgement, will he not find the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of my life more pleaſing and louely then the ordinary pangs of yours?</p>
               <p>And turning to the ſhepheardeſſe which had complained of <hi>Tyrcis:</hi> And you (inſenſible ſhepheardeſſe,) will neuer take the courage to free your ſelfe of the tyranny, in which this vnnaturall ſhepheard makes you liue. Will you by your patience make your ſelfe companion in his fault? Know you not that he glories in your teares, and that your ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons raiſe him to ſuch an arrogancie, that he thinkes he bindeth you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully to him, when he heares you with miſpriſall? The ſhepheardeſſe with a great alas anſwered him, It is eaſie, <hi>Hylas,</hi> for him that is in health, to counſell the ſicke; but if you were in my place, you would know how vaine it is thus to aduiſe me, and that this griefe may well driue my ſoule
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:177519:14"/>
out of my body, but not by reaſon chaſe this ouer-ſtrong paſſion out of my ſoule: So that if this beloued ſhepheard exerciſe any tyranny ouer me, he may do it with more abſolute commaund when it pleaſeth him, not hauing power to wiſh more of me, then his authoritie ouer me reacheth to already. Then giue ouer your counſels, <hi>Hylas,</hi> and ceaſe your repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which can but encreaſe my euill, without hope of aſſwaging. For I am ſo entirely the poſſeſſion of <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> that I haue not command of mine owne will. How (ſaid the ſhepheard) is not your will your owne? What will it profit to loue and ſerue you? <hi>Laonice</hi> anſwered, As much as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity which I tender to this ſhepheard auayles me. That is to ſay, replyed <hi>Hylas,</hi> I ſhall loſe my time and my paines; and when I diſcouer vnto you my affection, this is but to waken in you the words wherewith you may ſerue your owne turne when you ſpeake to <hi>Tyrcis.</hi> What would you, <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las,</hi> that I ſhould ſay more to you, but that it is long ſince I haue gone bewayling this miſ-happe, but much better in my conſideration then in yours? I doubt not (ſayd <hi>Hylas)</hi> but ſince you be of this humour, and that I haue more power ouer my ſelfe then you can ouer yours: Go take the ſhepheardeſſe (ſayd he) reaching forth his hand, or giue me leaue, or take it of me; and be aſſured, that if you will not, I will not be long before I goe backe, as being aſhamed to ſerue ſo poore a Miſtris. Shee anſwered him very coldly, Neither you nor I ſhall receiue any great loſſe, at the leaſt I aſſure you, this ſhall neuer make me forget the hard vſage which I haue from this ſhepheard. If you haue (anſwered he) as much knowledge of that which you loſe in loſing me, as you ſhew ſmall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the purſuite you vndertake, you will rather complaine for the loſſe of me, then to wiſh for the affection of <hi>Tyrcis?</hi> But the ſorrow which you take for me ſhall be very ſmall, if it can not equall that which I haue for you; and then ſung out theſe verſes as he went away.</p>

See, for Gods ſake, what her humor is; my brother neuer had any deſire, nay, ſo far was he of, he had not the power to loue any but her onely: ſhe knew it well enough, cruell as ſhe is; for the proofes which he hath giuen her, leaue nothing in doubt, the time hath bene ouerpaſt, the difficulties, or rather the impoſſibilities co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>temned, the abſences ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:177519:15"/>
the parents anger neglected, her rigors, her cruelties, her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines ſuſtained, and that for ſo long time, that I know no man could do more then <hi>Celadon,</hi> and yet for all this will not this fickle piece, who, as I thinke, hauing ingratefully changed her mind, is ſorry to ſee him longer liue, whom at other times ſhe hath done little leſſe then cauſe to dye by her rigours, and whom at this time ſhe knew ſhee hath vnworthily of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended: this fickle piece, I ſay, will not, who diſſembling vnder a new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of hate and iealouſie, commands him to eternall exile, and a deſpaire euen to ſeeking out of death. O God, ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> all amazed, what doe you tell me, <hi>Licidas?</hi> is it poſſible that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſhould commit ſuch a fault? It is too true, anſwered the ſhepheard, ſhe told me a part of it her ſelfe, &amp; the reſt I may eaſily iudge of by her diſcourſe. But well, though ſhee triumph ouer the life of my brother, and that her perfidiouſneſſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude giue a vizard to her fault, as if ſhe had ouerloued him, yet will I ſweare vnto you, that neuer Louer had more affection and fidelity then he, not that I care ſhe ſhould know it, vnleſſe it might bring her ſome extreme diſpleaſure by the knowledge of what might haue falne our by her error: for hence forth I will be as much her mortall enemie, as my brother hath bene her faithfull ſeruant, and ſhe vn worthy to be beloued. So went <hi>Licidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> diſcourſing, he infinitely diſpleaſed with the death of his brother, and as much enraged againſt <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and ſhe ſorry for <hi>Celadon,</hi> troubled with the griefe of <hi>Licidas,</hi> and aſtoniſhed at the ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of her companion: but ſeeing that the ſtroke was yet very ſenſible, ſhe would not as yet apply any ſtrong remedies, but only gentle prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues, to ſweeten &amp; not to confound; for in any caſe ſhe would not that the loſſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhould coſt her <hi>Licidas:</hi> and ſhe conſidered well, that if the hatred ſhould continue betweene him and <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> of neceſſity ſhee muſt breake with one of them: and yet loue was vnwilling to giue place to friendſhip, and friendſhip to loue; and ſo the one would not conſent to the death of the other. On the other ſide, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> euen full with ſo great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions of ſorrow as I haue told you, giuing ſuch way to her teares, and ſo languiſhed in her dolors, that for not hauing teares enow to waſh away her errour, nor words to expreſſe her ſorrow, her eyes and mouth gaue vp their office to her imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo long, that weakned with ouer-much griefe, ſhee fell aſleepe with ſuch thoughts.</p>

                     </gap>,</hi> all the beſt helpes that poſſibly they might: but the weakeneſſe which the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter brought him, was ſo great, that notwithſtanding all the remedies they applied, he could not open his eies, nor giue other ſigne of life, but by the beating of his heart. In this ſort hee paſſed the reſt of the day, and a good part of the night, before he came to himſelfe, and then when he opened his eyes, it was not without great aſtoniſhment, to finde himſelfe where he was; for he remembred well enough what befell him on the ſhore of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and that deſpaire had made him leap into the water, but he knew not how he came into this place: and after hee had ſtayed ſome while confounded with theſe thoughts, hee asked himſelfe whether he were aliue or dead? If I liue (ſaid he) how is it poſſible that the cruelty of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> doth not cauſe me to die? Or if I be dead, what is it, O Loue, that thou commeſt to ſearch for in darkeneſſe? Art thou not contented to haue had my life, but thou wilt among the cinders kindle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh the ancient flames? And becauſe the buſie care wherein <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had left him, was not abandoned, called to his minde all his thoughts, hee went on: And thou, moſt cruell remembrance of my paſſed good, why doeſt thou repreſent vnto mee, the diſpleaſure which ſhee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times had for my loſſe, to make my too true hurt worſe by her thoughts: whereas in place thereof, for mine eaſe, thou ſhouldeſt rather tell mee the contentment ſhe hath for the hatred ſhe beares me? With a thouſand ſuch imaginations, this poore ſhepheard fell into ſo ſound a ſleepe, that the Nymphs had leaſure to come and ſee how he did: and finding him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe, they ſoftly opened the windowes and the curtains, and ſate down
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:177519:16"/>
about to view him the better. <hi>Galathee,</hi> after ſhe had ſomewhile conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was the firſt that ſaid in a low voyce, that they might not awake him: How is this ſhepheard changed from that he was yeſterday? &amp; how freſh a colour is come into his face in ſo ſhort time? For my part, I am not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the trauaile of my iourney, ſince we haue ſaued his life: For as you ſay, mayd (turning to <hi>Siluie)</hi> he is one of the principall of that Countrey. Madame, anſwered the Nymph, it is moſt true, for his father is <hi>Alcippe,</hi> and his mother <hi>Amarillis.</hi> What, ſaid ſhe, that <hi>Alcippe,</hi> of whom I haue heard ſo much, and who to reſcue his friend, brake vp the priſon of the <hi>Viſigots?</hi> It is the very ſame, ſaid <hi>Siluie:</hi> I ſaw him about fiue or ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths agon, at an Holy-day-Feaſt, in the Hamlets that ſtand along the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and for that, aboue all the reſt, <hi>Alcippe</hi> in my iudgement, was moſt worthy to be reſpected. I long time held mine eyes on him: for the grauity of his beard and venerable olde age, made him to be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and eſteemed of euery man. But as for <hi>Celadon,</hi> I remember, that of all the yong ſhepheards, none but he and <hi>Siluander</hi> durſt come neere me. By <hi>Siluander</hi> I knew what was <hi>Celadon,</hi> and by <hi>Celadon</hi> what <hi>Siluander</hi> was. Both the one and the other had in their behauiour and diſcourſe, ſomewhat more generous then the name of Shepheard required. While <hi>Siluy</hi> was thus ſpeaking, Loue, to make ſport with the deceit of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manth</hi> and <hi>Polemas,</hi> which were the cauſe of <hi>Galatees</hi> going foorth that day, to the place where ſhe tooke vp <hi>Celadon,</hi> beganne to make the Nymph feele the effects of a new deſire. For while <hi>Siluy</hi> ſpake, <hi>Galatee</hi> had her eyes faſt vpon the ſhepheard; and the praiſes ſhe gaue him, were the cauſe, that at the ſame time, his beautie, and his vertue, the one, by the view, and the other, by the hearing, gaue a blow to her ſoule, and that more eaſily, for that ſhe was prepared by the practices of <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manthe,</hi> who ſeeming to be a diuine, had fore-told her, that he whom ſhe ſhould meet with, where ſhe found <hi>Celadon,</hi> was to be her husband, vnleſſe ſhe would be the moſt vnfortunate perſon in the world, hauing before laid a plot, that <hi>Polemas</hi> (as it were by chance) ſhould be there going at the houre which he had appoynted him, that being deluded by this tricke, ſhe might be made willing to marry him, which otherwiſe, the affection which ſhe bare to <hi>Lindamor,</hi> would not ſuffer. But For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune and Loue mocking at this wiſedome, made them finde <hi>Celadon</hi> by the chance which I told you of. So that <hi>Galatee</hi> determining, in any ſort to loue this ſhepherd, went purpoſely to repreſent to her ſelf euery thing in him more louely. And ſeeing that he awaked not, that ſhe might leaue him to his more quiet reſt, ſhe got out as ſoftly as poſſibly ſhe
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:177519:16"/>
could, and went to intertaine her new thoughts.</p>
               <p>There was by her chamber a pretty ſtaire, which deſcended into a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer gallery, where by a draw-bridge they might enter into a garden furniſhed with all the rarities which the place could admit, were it in Fountaines, in quarters, were it in allies and arbours, nothing being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten that arte could adde to it. At the going out of this place, one might enter into a great wood of diuers ſorts of trees, wherof one was of Haſels which altogether made ſo pleaſing a Labyrinth, that though the paths by their diuers turnings loſt themſelues confuſedly, the one within the other, yet were they very delightſome for their ſhaddowes.</p>
               <p>Not far off within another quarter, was the fountaine of the truth of loue, a ſpring indeed very marueilous: for by the force of enchantments, the louer when he looked into it, might ſee her whom hee loued: if he were beloued of her, he ſhould ſee himſelfe hard by her: if it fortuned ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued another, the other ſhould be repreſented, &amp; not himſelfe: and becauſe it diſcouered the deceits of louers, they named it The truth of Loue. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the quarters, was the den of <hi>Damon</hi> &amp; Fortune; &amp; laſtly, the hole of <hi>Mandrague,</hi> full of ſuch rarities and ſo many ſorceries, that houre after houre there falls out alwaies ſome new thing: beſides that, thorowout the reſt of the wood, there be many other diuers caues liuely counterfay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that the eye often beguiles the iudgement.</p>
               <p>Now it was within this garden that the Nymph came out to walke, attending for the awaking of the ſhepheard; and becauſe her new deſires would not ſuffer her to hold her peace, ſhe fained to haue forgotten ſomething, which ſhe commanded <hi>Siluie</hi> to go and ſeeke for, for that ſhe put the leſſe truſt in her for her youth, then in <hi>Leonide,</hi> who was much el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; both theſe Nymphs were truſted with her greateſt ſecrets. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelfe alone with <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſhe ſaid to her, What thinke you, <hi>Leonide?</hi> hath not the Druyde great knowledge of things? and doe not the gods very liberally communicate with him; ſince the things that are to come, are better known to him, then the preſent to vs? Without doubt (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Nymph) he made you ſee right truly, in the glaſſe, the very place where you found this ſhepheard: and he told you truly the time, in which you met with him; but his ſpeeches were ſo doubtfull, that I can hardly beleeue he vnderſtands himſelf. Why ſay you ſo (anſwered <hi>Galathee)</hi> ſince he told me ſo particularly all that I haue found, that I know not now to ſay more then he did? So me thinkes it was (anſwered <hi>Leonide)</hi> that he onely told you, you ſhould finde in that place there, a iewell ineſtimable, which when it came to paſſe, was a thing to be ſcorned. <hi>Galathee</hi> then
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:177519:17"/>
laughing at her, ſaid, Why, <hi>Leonide,</hi> know you nothing elſe? Then muſt you learne what he told me in particular. Madame, you haue two influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences quite contrary; the one, the moſt infortunate that may be vnder heauen; the other, the moſt happy that a man may deſire: and it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth of your owne election, to take that which you will; and that you may not deceiue your ſelfe, know that you are, and ſhalbe ſerued of many great Knights, whoſe vertues and merits may diuerſly mooue you; but if you meaſure your affection either to their merits, or to the iudgement which you ſhall giue of their loue, and not by that which I inſtruct you, on the behalfe of the gods, I fore-tell you, you ſhalbe the moſt miſerable that liues: and that you be not deceiued in your election, remember that on ſuch a day, that you ſee at <hi>Marſellys</hi> a Knight attired in ſuch a colour, who ſeekes, or ſhall ſeeke to marry you (for if you admit him from thence, I ſhall euer bewaile your misfortune, and I cannot ſufficiently threaten againſt you the incredible diſaſters which attend you) and therefore I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe you to flee from that man whom you may rather terme your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune then your louer. But contrarily, marke well the place which is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented within this glaſſe, to the end you may know to find him along the riuer of <hi>Lignon.</hi> For ſuch a day, at ſuch an houre, you ſhall meete a man, in the loue of whom the heauens haue placed all your felicitie. If you can ſo worke that he may loue you, thinke not the gods good of their word, if you can wiſh for more contentment then you ſhall haue; but haue care, that the firſt of you two that firſt ſees the other, be the party that firſt loues. Thinke you not, that this is to ſpeake plainely and clearely; eſpecially for that I haue ſince felt theſe predictions true which he gaue me. For, hauing ſeen this ſhepheard firſt (I muſt not lie) mee thinkes I find in me certayne ſparkles of goodwill to him. How Madam! (ſaid <hi>Leonide)</hi> will you loue a ſhepheard? Do you not remember who you are? I do ſo <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid ſhe, I remember my ſelfe well enough, but you muſt alſo know, that theſe ſhepheards are as good as Druides or Knights, &amp; their Nobility is as great as others, being all deſcended from the antiquity of the ſame ſtocke, ſo that the exerciſe where to they addict themſelues, cannot make vs others then we are from our birth; ſo that if this ſhepheard be wel borne, why ſhould not I think him as worthy of me as any other? Finally, Madam (ſaid ſhe) he is a ſhepheard, how euer you diſguiſe him. In fine, ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> he is an honeſt man, how euer you will qualifie him.</p>
               <p>But Madam (anſwered <hi>Leonide)</hi> you that are ſo great a Nymph, the Lady after <hi>Amaſis,</hi> of all theſe goodly Countries, wil you haue a minde ſo
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177519:17"/>
baſe, to loue a man borne of the meaner ſort of people, a clowne, a ſhepheard, a fellow of no worth? My friend (replyed <hi>Galathee)</hi> leaue theſe reproches, and remember that <hi>Enone</hi> made her ſelfe a ſhepheardeſſe for <hi>Paris,</hi> and when ſhe had loſt him, ſhe lameuted, and wept away in hot teares. Madame (ſaid <hi>Leonide)</hi> he was the ſonne of a King; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the errour of another ought not to cauſe you to fall into the ſame fault. If it be a fault, anſwered ſhe, I referre my ſelfe to the gods, who haue counſelled me by the Oracle of their Druide: but that <hi>Celadon</hi> is not borne of as good bloud as <hi>Paris,</hi> my friend, thou haſt no brayn if thou ſayſt ſo; for, are they not ſprung of one originall? Moreouer, haue you not heard what <hi>Siluie</hi> talkt of him and his father? You muſt know that they are not ſhepheards, for not hauing meanes to liue otherwiſe, but to buy by this ſweete life, an honeſt quietneſſe. And how, Madame, reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>Leonide,</hi> haue you alſo forgot the affection and ſeruices of the gentle <hi>Lindamaur?</hi> I would not, ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> that forgetfulneſſe ſhould be the reward of his ſeruices, neither would I alſo, that the loue Lought to bear him, ſhould be the ruine of all my contentments. Ah Madame, ſaid <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onide,</hi> remember how faithfull he hath beene. Ah my friend, ſaid <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee,</hi> conſider that this is the way to be eternally vnhappy. For my part, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> I ſhrug with my ſhoulders at theſe iudgements of loue, and know not what to ſay, but onely, that extreme affection, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire fidelitie, the employment of an whole age, and a continuall ſeruice, ſhould not be ſo long receiued; or receiued, deſerue to be payd with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther money then a change. For Gods ſake, Madame, conſider how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull they are, that tell other mens fortunes, that for the moſt part, they are but ſleight imaginations which their dreames brought forth; for the moſt part lying, that of an hundred accidents which they fore-tell, hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one falls out to be true, and for the moſt part, ignorant, ſince buſying themſelues to know the fortune of another, they cannot finde their own. And doe not you, for the fantaſticall diſcourſe of this fellow, make ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable the man that is ſo deare to you. Set before your eyes how hee loues you, in what dangers he hath beene thruſt into for you; what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate he had with <hi>Polemas,</hi> and what his deſpaire hath bin; what griefes doe you now prepare for him, and what deathes will you cauſe him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>oin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent for his deſtruction, if he haue knowledge of this. <hi>Galathee</hi> wagging her head, anſwered her: You ſee, <hi>Leonide,</hi> the buſineſſe is not now about the choyce of <hi>Lindamaur,</hi> or <hi>Polemas,</hi> as here to fore, but of my wel, or euil doing. The conſiderations which you haue, are good to you whom my misfortune touches not, but by way of compaſſion, yet to me they are
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:177519:18"/>
exceeding dangerous, ſince it is not for a day, but for euer, that this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune threatens me. If I were in your place, and you in mine, it may be, I would aduiſe you as you doe me. But vndoubtedly an euerlaſting misfortune terrifies me: as for the lyes of theſe men you ſpeake of, I will beleeue for your ſake, that it may be it will not ſo fall out, yet it may be alſo, that it will fall out; and then tell me, I pray you, thinke you that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for wiſe, that for the contentment of another, wil leaue on the ballance (it may be) all his good or euill? If you loue me, hold not on this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, otherwiſe I muſt thinke that you reſpect more the contentment of <hi>Lindamaur,</hi> then mine. And touching him, make no queſtion but he will ſeeke his conſolation by ſome other meanes then death: for both reaſon and time are both ſoueraigne helpes to this fury; and indeed, how many haue you ſeene of theſe great deſpairers vpon like occaſion, that, ſome while after, haue not repented of their deſpaires?</p>
               <p>Thus did theſe faire Nymphs diſcourſe, when far off they ſaw <hi>Siluie</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, from whom, becauſe ſhe was ſo yong, <hi>Galathee</hi> was deſirous to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, as I ſaid. This was the cauſe ſhe cut off her diſcourſe ſo ſhort: yet ſhe forbare not to ſay to <hi>Leonide,</hi> If euer you loued me, you would make it appeare to me at this time, ſince it is not only far from my contentment, but from my felicity alſo. <hi>Leonide</hi> could not anſwere her, becauſe <hi>Siluie</hi> was ſo neere that ſhe might ouerheare. Being come, <hi>Galathea</hi> knew that <hi>Celadon</hi> was awake: for at the doore ſhe heard him grone and ſigh. And it was true: for in a while after they were gone out of the chamber, he waked ſuddenly, and becauſe the Sun ſhone full on his bed, thorow the glaſſe, at the opening of his eyes, he was ſo dazeled and confounded with ſo great brightneſſe, that he knew not where he was, the trauaile of the day paſſed had ſo weakned him; yet by this time he felt no maner of grief: ſo that calling into his mind his fall into <hi>Lignon,</hi> and the opinion that hee had had a little before of being dead, ſeeing himſelfe now in ſo confuſed a brightneſſe, he knew not what to iudge, except it were that Loue had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him vp into heauen for a reward of his faithfulneſſe: and that which abuſed him more in this point, was, that when his ſight began to extend it ſelfe, hee ſaw nothing about him, but the deckings of gold and of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome pictures, with which all the roome was adorned, &amp; which his feeble eyes could not as yet diſcerne from counterfait.</p>
               <p>On the one ſide, hee ſaw <hi>Saturne</hi> leaning on his ſickle, with his haire long, his forehead rough, his eyes hollow, his noſe hooked like an Egle, his mouth dropping with bloud, &amp; full with the morſels of his children, whereof he held one halfe eaten in his left hand; in which, in the opening
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:177519:18"/>
which he had made on the ſide with his teeth, a man might ſee the lights, as it were to pant, and the heart to tremble. A ſight indeed full of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: for that child had the head writhed ouer the ſhoulders, the arme han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging forward, and the legs ſtretching out one way and other, all red with the bloud which iſſued from the wound which the olde man had made, whoſe long beard &amp; locks, in many places, were ſtained with the bloud which fell from the morſels which he tore out to deuoure; his armes and legs full of nerues, and were in diuers places couered with haire, his thighs leane and fleſh-falne, vnder his feete lay great pieces of bones, where of ſome were white for age, ſome began but to bee bare, and others ioyned with a little skin and fleſh halfe conſumed, ſhewed that they were but lately layd there.</p>
               <p>Neere him one might ſee nothing but Scepters in pieces torne, Crowns, great buildings ruined, &amp; that in ſuch ſort, that hardly remained any liuely reſemblance of what they had bene.</p>
               <p>Not farre from thence, one might ſee the <hi>Corebantes</hi> with their Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balls and Hoboyes, hide the little <hi>Iupiter</hi> in a den, from the deuouring teeth of that father. Then a little beſides, you might ſee him grown great with a viſage enflamed, but graue and full of maieſtly, his eyes milde, but ſtriking an awe, a Crowne on his head, in his left hand a Scepter, which he reſted on his thigh, where was yet to be ſeene the skarre of the wound which he made, when through the imprudence of the Nymph <hi>Semele,</hi> that he might ſaue the little <hi>Bacchus,</hi> he was conſtraind to open that part, and to beare him vntill the end of the terme. In his other hand he had the lightening caſt into three poynts, which was ſo liuely repreſented, that it ſeemed then to flie in the aire. He had his feete on a great Globe, and by him you might ſee a great Eagle, that bare in his hooked beake, a thunderbolt, and came neere him, rayſing the head toward him, as high as his knees. On the backe of this Bird was the young <hi>Ganimede,</hi> atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after the faſhion of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that dwell in the mount <hi>Ida</hi> fat, plump, white, his lockes golden and frizled, that with one hand ſtroked the head of the Bird, and with the other, reached foorth to take the lightening from <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> who with his elbow, and not otherwiſe, gently thruſt aſide his feeble arme. A little aſide might one ſee the Cup and Ewre, in which this little taſter that ſerued Nectar to his Maſter, ſo liuely ſet out, that this young ſeruitour ſtriuing to waite at <hi>Iupiters</hi> hand, ſtumbled with one foote, it ſeemed to be ready to fall, and the little one purpoſely tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his head, to ſee how it came. At the foote of this god was a great veſſell, on the right hand was the good, and on the other the euill, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177519:19"/>
within were vowes, prayers and ſacrifices, diuerſly figured: for the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was repreſented by the ſmoke, intermingled with fire; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, the vowes and ſupplications ſeemed like quicke Ideaes, and halfe marked, but ſo, that the eie might diſcerne it.</p>
               <p>It would be too long a Diſcourſe, to relate particularly all thoſe pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures. So it was, that euery part of the Chamber was full: euen <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelfe within her marine ſhell, among other things, caſteth her eye on the ſtarre the Greeks had made her in the warres of <hi>Troy.</hi> And on the other ſide, you might ſee little <hi>Cupid</hi> making much of her, with the hurt on his ſhoulder, from the lampe of the curious <hi>Pſiche:</hi> And this ſo well repreſented, that the ſhepheard could not diſcerne it from counterfeit. And after he had beene long in theſe thoughts, the three Nymphes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred the Chamber, the beauty and maieſty of whom rauiſhed him yet into a greater admiration. But that which perſwaded him the rather to the opinion that he was dead, was, that when he ſaw the Nymphes, he tooke them to be the three Graces, and eſpecially, ſeeing the little <hi>Merill</hi> come in with them, whoſe height, youth, beauty, with his haire frizled, and louely faſhion, made him iudge him to be Loue. And though he were confounded in himſelfe, yet ſo it was, that that courage which he had alwayes greater then fitted the name of a ſhepheard, gaue him aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance (after he had ſaluted them) to demaund in what place he was. Where to <hi>Galathee</hi> anſwered: <hi>Celadon,</hi> you are in a place where they haue a deſire to recouer you wholy: we are they, that finding you in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, haue conueyed you hither, where you haue all at your command.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Siluia</hi> rayſing her ſelfe, <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſaid ſhe, is it poſſible you ſhould not know me? doe you remember you haue ſeene me in your hamlet?

How, ſayd the Nymph? remember you no better, that the Nymph <hi>Siluie,</hi> and two of her companions went to ſee your ſacrifices and ſports, the day that you conſecrated to the Goddeſſe <hi>Venus?</hi> The accident befalne you, hath it made you forget, that after you had won the prize from your fellowes, at the Lute, <hi>Siluie</hi> was ſhe that gaue you for reward a garland of flowers, which preſently you ſee on the head of <hi>Aſtrea?</hi> I know not if all theſe things bee blotted out of your memory: but this I know wel, that when you layd the garland on the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:177519:19"/>
but that <hi>Amarillis</hi> hauing bene<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> beloued of theſe two ſhepheards, and that betweene the riualls there hath alwayes bene ſmall friendſhip, they came oftentimes to handblowes, vntill <hi>Amarillis</hi> eſpouſed your father, and then <hi>Alce,</hi> and the wiſe <hi>Hipolita</hi> whom hee after married, nouriſhed ſo great hatred againſt them, that it would neuer after ſuffer them to conuerſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Now ſee, <hi>Celadon,</hi> if I know you not well enough, and if I giue you not good tokens of that I ſay. The ſhepheard hearing theſe words, by little and little, came to memory of that which ſhe ſaid, and yet hee was ſo aſtoniſhed, that he knew not what to anſwere.</p>
               <p>For not knowing <hi>Siluie,</hi> but for the Nymph of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and by reaſon of his country life, hauing had no familiarity with her, nor with her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, he could not iudge for what cauſe, nor how he was at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent among them. In the end he anſwered: That which you ſay (faire Nymph) is very true: that on <hi>Venus</hi> her day three Nymphes gaue the three prizes, whereof I had that for the Lute; <hi>Licidas</hi> my brother that for the courſe, which he gaue to <hi>Phillis;</hi> and <hi>Siluander,</hi> that for the ſong, which he preſented to the daughter of the faire <hi>Belinde;</hi> but remember the names which they had, I can not: ſo that being hindered from our ſports, all that wee were content to know, was, that they were the Nymphs of <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Galathee.</hi> For as for vs, as our bodies part not from our paſtures, ſo our ſports make vs nothing curious. And then (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Galathee)</hi> Haue you knowne no more? That which informed my knowledge (anſwered the ſhepheard) was the diſcourſe which my father made me often of his fortunes, in the which I haue often heard him make mention of <hi>Amaſis;</hi> but not of any thing particularly that concerned her, though I haue earneſtly deſired him. This deſire (replies <hi>Galathee)</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commendable, to giue him ſatisfaction, and therefore I will tell you particularly, both what <hi>Amaſis</hi> is, and what we are.</p>
               <p>Know then (gentle ſhepheard) that of antiquitie, this Country which at this preſent is called <hi>Forreſts,</hi> was couered with great Lakes of water, and that there was nothing but the high mountaynes that you ſee round about that was vncouered, except ſome points within the middle of the Plaine, as the rocke of the wood of <hi>Iſoure,</hi> and of mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> ſo that the Inhabitants abode on the toppes of the mountaines: And therefore it is, that euen yet the ancient families of this Countrey haue the buildings of their names in the more lofty places, and in the high mountaines. And for proofe of that I ſay, you may yet on the toppe of <hi>Iſoure,</hi> and mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> and about the Caſtle of <hi>Marſellis,</hi> ſee great<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rings of yron in the rocke where the veſſels were faſtened, there begin no likelyhood they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:177519:20"/>
could ſerue for any other vſe. But, it may be, about ſome foureteene or fifteene ages ſince, a certaine Romane, who in ten yeeres conquered all the Gaules, cauſed ſome mountaines to be cut downe, by which the water voyded away; and not long after, the boſome of our Plaines were diſcouered, which ſeemed ſo pleaſant and fertile, that he purpoſed to haue it inhabited; and for this purpoſe, he made all thoſe that liued in the mountaines, and within the forreſts, to deſcend, and willed, that the firſt building that was then made, ſhould beare the name of <hi>Iulius,</hi> which he had; and becauſe the place was moiſt and ſlimy, it yeelded great ſtore of trees. Some ſay the place was called Forreſts, and the people, Forreſters, in ſtead of <hi>Seguſiens,</hi> which they were named before: but they are much deceiued. For the name of <hi>Forreſts</hi> commeth of <hi>Forum.</hi> which is <hi>Feurs,</hi> a little towne which the Romanes cauſed to be built, and which they named <hi>Forum Seguſionorum,</hi> as if they would ſay, The place or the March of the <hi>Seguſians,</hi> which properly is but the place where they kept their armies, during the time that they gaue order to the neighbour countries.</p>
               <p>See, <hi>Celadon,</hi> what they hold for certaine, of the Antiquity of this Prouince: but there are two opinions contrary to this, which I would tell you. The Romanes ſay, that from the time that our plaine was yet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerd with water, the chaſte Goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> delighted ſo much in it, that ſhe abode in it almoſt continually: for her <hi>Driades,</hi> and <hi>Amadriades</hi> li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and hunted in this great Wood, and high mountaines which inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this great quantity of waters: and becauſe there were ſtore of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, ſhe came ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bathe her ſelfe with her <hi>Nayades,</hi> which kept there ordinarily. But when the waters were voyded, the <hi>Nayades</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained follow them, and to go with them into the boſome of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean,</hi> ſo that the Goddeſſe found her ſelfe at one inſtant deſtitute of the halfe part of her Nymphes. And this was the cauſe, that not being able with ſo ſmall a troop to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue her ordinary paſtime, ſhe choſe out ſome daughters of the chiefe Druides and knights, whom ſhe ioyned with the Nymphes that remained, to whom ſhe gaue likewiſe the name of Nymph. But it fell out, as in the end, the abuſe peruerts all order, that many of them, which in their youth had beene bred in the houſe, ſome among the commodities of a louing mother; others, among the allurements of ſights and ſeruices of Louers, not able to hold out in the trauaile of hunting, nor baniſh out of their memories, the honeſt affections of thoſe, that ſometimes made ſuite vnto them, would retire to their owne home, and marry: and ſome others, whom the Goddeſſe denyed leaue, failed in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:177519:20"/>
their promiſes, and in their honeſty; which ſo much prouoked her, that ſhe reſolued to forſake that profane countrey, as ſhe took it, for this vice, which ſhe ſo much abhorred. But becauſe ſhe would not puniſh the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſome, with the error of others; before ſhe went away, ſhe ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly chaſed out, and for euer baniſhed out of the Countrey all thoſe which had offended, &amp; made choyce of one, to whom ſhe gaue the ſame Authority, which ſhe had ouer all the Countrey; and willed, that for euer the race of her ſhould haue all the command, and then permitted them to marry, but with expreſſe prohibition, that the men ſhould neuer ſucceed. Since that time there was neuer any abuſe among vs, and the lawes haue inuiolably beene obſerued. But our Druides talke in another manner; for they ſay, that our great Princeſſe <hi>Galathee,</hi> the daughter of the King <hi>Celtes,</hi> wife of the great <hi>Hercules,</hi> and mother of <hi>Galathee,</hi> who gaue name to the <hi>Gaules,</hi> who formerly had beene called <hi>Celtes,</hi> full of loue to her husband, followed him, whither his courage and vertue carried him, among the Monſters, and againſt the Gyants.</p>
               <p>And by fortune, at that time the mountaines which ſeparated vs from <hi>Auerne,</hi> and thoſe which bend towards the left hand, which they call <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mene</hi> and <hi>Gebenne,</hi> ſerued for a place of retrait to ſome Gaints, which by their force made themſelues terrible to all men. <hi>Hercules</hi> being aduerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed hereof, came; and becauſe he loued very tenderly his deare <hi>Galathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> he left her, in this country which was next neighbour, and wherein ſhe tooke great pleaſure, what for the game, what for the company of the daughters of that country. And for that ſhe was Queene of all the <hi>Gaules,</hi> when <hi>Hercules</hi> had vanquiſhed the Gaints, and that the neceſſity of his affaires compelled him to go other where, before their departure to leaue an eternall memory of the delight ſhe tooke in this country, ſhe made thoſe ordinances, which the Romanes ſay, the Goddeſſe <hi>Diana</hi> did. But were it <hi>Galathee</hi> or <hi>Diana,</hi> ſo it is, that by a ſupernaturall priuiledge we haue beene particularly maintained in our franchiſes, ſince that of ſo many peoples, which like a torrent, were powred out ouer all <hi>Gaule,</hi> there was not one that hath diſquieted vs in our repoſe, Euen <hi>Alarick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It may be you may thinke it ſtrange that I talke to you ſo particularly of the things, which are beyond the capacity of thoſe of my age: but you muſt know, that <hi>Pimander,</hi> who was my father, hath beene curious to ſearch out the antiquities of this Countrey, in ſuch ſort, that the more vnderſtanding Druides diſcourſed to him ordinarily, while

And thus I knew, that in one continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line, <hi>Amaſis</hi> my mother was deſcended from them, whom the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Galathee</hi> made choice of. And therefore it is, that being Lady of all thoſe Countries, and hauing yet a ſonne called <hi>Clidaman,</hi> ſhe brings vp wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The maides go attyred as you ſee vs, which is a kind of habite that <hi>Diana</hi> or <hi>Galathee</hi> vſed to weare, and which wee haue alwayes maintained in memory of her. See, <hi>Celadon,</hi> that which you deſire to know of our eſtate, and I make account before you goe away, (for I would you will ſee vs all together) that you might ſay that our company giueth place to none other, neyther in vertue nor yet in beautie.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Celadon</hi> knowing who theſe faire Nymphes were, knew alſo what reſpect he was to ſhew them; and though he had not beene accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to be among others then Shepheards his like, yet ſuch was the good breeding that he had, that it taught him well enough what was due to ſuch perſonages. Then, after he had done them the honour which he thought he was bound to: But (ſayd he, holding on) I can not but be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed, to be among ſo many great Nymphes, I that am but a ſimple ſhepheard, and to receiue ſo many fauours of them. <hi>Celadon</hi> (anſwered <hi>Galathee)</hi> in what place ſoeuer Vertue is, it deſerues to be loued and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, as well vnder the habite of ſhepheards, as vnder the glorious purple of kings; and for your particular, you are with vs of no leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, then the greateſt of the <hi>Druides</hi> or knights in our Court: for you are not to giue place to them in fauour, ſith you doe not in merit. And for your being among vs, know you, that it is not without a great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie from our gods, which haue appoynted it, as you may know at lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, whether it be, that they will no longer, that ſo many vertues re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayne among the Sauages in the forreſt and countrey townes, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, that they will worke a deſſigne in you, aduauncing you greater then you are, to make moſt happy by you, the perſon that loueth you. Liue onely in reſt, and looke to your health. For there is nothing you ſhould more deſire, in the ſtate wherein you are, then health. Madam (anſwered the ſhepheard, who vnderſtood not the words well) If I be to deſire health, the chiefe cauſe is, that I may be able to doe you ſome ſeruice, in exchange of ſo many fauours, which it hath pleaſed you to doe me. It is true, that I neede not tell you that I came from the wood or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177519:21"/>
paſtures, otherwiſe the ſolemne vow which our fathers haue made vnto the gods, will accuſe vs to them, as vnworthy children of ſuch fathers. And what oath is it, anſwered the Nymph? The hiſtory, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> would be too long, if I ſhould tell you the cauſe that my father <hi>Alcippe</hi> had to hold it. So it is, that many yeeres ſince, of a generall accord, all thoſe that kept along the riuers of <hi>Loyre,</hi> of <hi>Lignon,</hi> of <hi>Furan,</hi> of <hi>Argent,</hi> and of all other riuers, after he had well vnderſtood the diſcommoditie, which the ambition of a people called Romanes, made their neighbours feele, out of deſire of dominion, aſſembled together in a great Plaine, which is neere the mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> and there by a mutuall agreement ſware all, to flie for euer from all ſort of ambition, for that it alone was cauſe of ſo much paynes, and to liue, they and theirs, vnder the peaceable ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite of ſhepheards, and ſince that, it hath beene obſerued (the gods ſo well liked this vow) that none of them that made it, nor their ſucceſſors, but he had trauell and paynes incredible, if he obſerued it not; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all, my father is an example moſt remarkeable, and moſt new: So that hauing knowne, that the will of heauen is, that we ſhould keepe in reſt that which we haue to liue on; we haue of late renewed this vow, with ſo many oaths, that he that breakes it, ſhall become moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Truely (ſayd the Nymph) I am well pleaſed to heare that you tell me, for it is long ſince I heard them talke of it, and I could neuer yet know, why ſo many good and ancient Families as I he are there are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, imploy themſelues out of the townes, to ſpend their age in the woods and places moſt ſolitary. But, <hi>Celadon,</hi> if the caſe wherein you are, will ſuffer, tell me, I pray you, what hath beene the fortune of your father <hi>Alcippe,</hi> to make him take againe that kinde of life, which he had ſo long time left; for I aſſure my ſelfe, the diſcourſe is worthy to bee knowne. Then, though he felt himſelfe yet euill of the water which he had ſwallowed, yet he conſtrained himſelfe to obey her, and beganne in this ſort:</p>
               <div type="part">

                     <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Alcippe.</head>
                  <p>YOu command me (Madame) to tell you the fortune moſt croſſe and diuerſe of any man in the world, and in which one may learne, that he that will worke trouble to another, prepares a great part to himſelfe. But ſince you will haue it ſo, and that I may not diſobey you, I will tell you briefly, that which I haue learned by ordinary diſcourſe from himſelfe, to whom al theſe things haue befalne: For, that we might vnderſtand how
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:177519:22"/>
happy we were to liue in quietneſſe of ſpirit, my father hath often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted vnto vs his ſtrange fortunes. Know then (Madame) that <hi>Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> hauing beene bred by his father, in the ſimplicitie of a ſhepheard, had a ſpirit ſo differing from his education, that euery thing pleaſed him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then that that ſauoured of the village. So that this young Infant, for a preſage of what he would come to, and to which when he was in yeeres, he addicted himſelfe, had no greater delight, then to make aſſemblies of other children like himſelfe, whom he tooke vpon to ſet in order, and to arme ſome with ſtaues, ſome with bowes and arrows, whom he taught to draw right, the menaces of the olde and wiſe ſhepheards not being able to diuert him.</p>
                  <p>The ancients of our Hamlets ſeeing his actions, fore-told of great troubles in theſe countries; and aboue all, that <hi>Alcippe</hi> would be of a tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent ſpirit, that would neuer reſt with in the limits of a ſhepherd. When he came to the balfe part of his age, by chance he fel amorous of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſſe <hi>Amarillis,</hi> who at that time was ſecretly wooed of another ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard his neighbour, called <hi>Alce.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Alcippe</hi> had ſo good an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of himſelfe, that he thought that there was not any ſhepheardeſſe, who would not as freely entertaine his affection as he offered it, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to vſe no great Art to tell her it: ſo that meeting her at the ſacrifice of <hi>Pan,</hi> as ſhe returned home, he ſaid vnto her, I neuer thought I was of ſo ſmall force, that I could not reſiſt the blowes of an enemy, that wounds me vnawares. She anſwered; He that wounds by miſtaking, ſhould not be called an enemy. No, anſwered he, which reſt not on deedes, but on words onely; but (for my part) I finde that he that offends, howſoeuer it be, is an enemy, and therefore I may well giue you that name. To me (replied ſhe?) I would neyther haue the deed nor the thought, for I make too great account of your merit. See (adioyned the ſhepheard) one of the blowes wherein you offend mee more, in telling mee one thing for another, then if truly you would acknowledge in me that which you ſay, for that I hold my ſelfe wronged by you, in aſmuch as you ſay you fauour me. But I ſee well, you thinke it enough, to beare Loue in your eyes, and in your mouth, without giuing him place in your heart. The ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe then finding her ſelfe ſurpriſed, as not hauing vnderſtood his ſpeech of loue, anſwered him: I make account, <hi>Alcippe,</hi> of your vertue, as I ought, and not beyond my duty; and touching that you talke of loue, beleeue it, I will haue it neyther in mine eyes, nor in my heart for any man, and much leſſe for thoſe baſe ſpirits, which liue like Sauages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the woods. I know well (replyed the ſhepheard) that it is not the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:177519:22"/>
election of Loue, but my deſtiny, which compels me to be yours, ſince that if Loue ought to ariſe from the reſemblance of humour, it would be very hard, that <hi>Alcippe</hi> ſhould not be for you, who from his Cradle hath hated this countrey life, and proteſteth vnto you, if I muſt change my condition, to haue a part in your loue, from hencefoorth I forſake the Sheephooke and my Flockes, and will liue among men, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Sauages.</p>
                  <p>You may well (anſwered <hi>Amarillis)</hi> change your condition, but not make me change, being reſolued to be neuer leſſe mine owne, then I am now, to giue place to any ſtronger affection: if you will, wee ſhould continue, the life which we haue led, for the time paſt; change this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of affection, &amp; of Loue, into that you were wont to vſe to me here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, or elſe thinke not ſtrange, that I baniſh my ſelfe from your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, it being impoſſible that Loue, and the honeſt <hi>Amarillis</hi> ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine together. <hi>Alcippe,</hi> that lookt for no ſuch anſwere, ſeeing himſelfe ſo far from his hopes, was ſo confounded, that he ſtaid ſomewhile before he could anſwere. In the end, being come to himſelfe, he began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelfe, that the baſhfulneſſe of her age, and ſexe, and not want of good will towards him, had made her hold this courſe: Therefore it was that he anſwered her; Whatſoeuer you thinke of me, I ſhall neuer be other then your ſeruant; and if the commandement you giue me, were not diſagreeing with my affection, you were to thinke, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world that might make me contradict it: you muſt then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, and ſuffer me to hold on my purpoſe, which is but a teſtimoniall of your merit, and wherein, will you, nill you, I am reſolued. The ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe turning her eyes ſweetly towards him, I know not, <hi>Alcippe,</hi> ſaid ſhe, whether for a wager, or out of obſtinacy you talke thus. It is (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he) for both, for I haue laid a wager with my deſires, to conquer you, or to dye; and this reſolution is changed into obſtinacy, there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that can diuert me from the othe which I haue made. I would be well pleaſed, replied <hi>Amarillis,</hi> that you had taken any other for the But of ſuch importunities. You may name my affections (ſayd the ſhepherd) as it pleaſeth you: yet ſhall not this make me change my mind. Nor you muſt not thinke much, replied <hi>Amarillis,</hi> if I be as firme in my obſtinacy, as you in your importunity. The ſhepheard would haue anſwered, but that hee was interrupted by many ſhepheardeſſes that came to them. So that <hi>Amarillis</hi> for concluſion ſayd very ſoftly to him, You may do me a diſpleaſure, if your purpoſe be knowne: for I am contented to know your follies, and it will be ſmall pleaſure that any others ſhould vnderſtand it.

So ended the firſt diſcourſe betweene my father and <hi>Amarillis,</hi> which did but encreaſe the deſire in him to ſerue her; for nothing addeth ſo much to Loue, as honeſty: And by fortune in the way, this company met with <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> and <hi>Bellinde,</hi> who were ſtayed to behold two turtles, who were chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring &amp; making loue each to other, no whit afraid to ſee many about them.

At this time, as I told you, <hi>Alce</hi> made ſuite to <hi>Amarillis,</hi> and becauſe he was a right honeſt ſhepheard, and eſteemed wiſe, the father of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis</hi> inclined rather to giue her to him, and not to <hi>Alcippe,</hi> becauſe of his turbulent courage; and on the contrary, the ſhepheardeſſe better loued my father, becauſe his humour came neerer to hers; which the wiſe father well perceiuing, and not willing to vſe any violence, nor abſolute autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ouer her, he thought, that farre diſtance might diuert her from this will, and ſo reſolued to ſend her for ſome time to <hi>Artemis,</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce,</hi> who dwelt about the bankes of the riuer of <hi>Allier.</hi> When <hi>Amarillis</hi> knew the deliberation of her father, as alwaies they endeuour to things forbidden; ſhe tooke a reſolution not to goe away, before ſhe had giuen <hi>Alcippe</hi> aſſurance of her good will: in this deſſigne ſhe wrote theſe words:</p>

Some little while before the mother of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis</hi> died, and they made preparation in the great towne of <hi>Marſellis,</hi> to receiue her as their new Lady with much triumph. And becauſe the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which they made, drew for curioſity, almoſt all the Countrey, my
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177519:24"/>
father ſo wrought, that he had leaue to goe thither. And there it was whence the beginning of all his trauailes proceeded. He was about his halfe age, ſome Moones more, his face faire among thoſe of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, his haire yellowiſh, curled, and criſped by nature, which hee wore long: and briefly, Madam, ſuch, as to whom Loue (it may be) owed ſome ſecret vengeance. And ſee how he was ſeene of ſome Lady, and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly beloued of her, that we could neuer yet know her name. At the firſt that he arriued at <hi>Marſellis,</hi> hee was clothed like a ſhepheard, but handſomly enough, for his father made much of him: and that he might not commit ſome fooliſh trick, as his manner was, in the Hamlet, he ſet two or three ſhepheards about him, to haue a care of him; principally one, called <hi>Cleante,</hi> a man whoſe humour pleaſed his father well, ſo that he loued him, as if he had beene his ſonne. This <hi>Cleante</hi> had one called <hi>Clindor,</hi> of my fathers age, who, by nature, ſeemed to haue the ſame incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to loue <hi>Alcippe; Alcippe,</hi> who on the other ſide, knew his affection, loued him aboue any other; which was ſo pleaſing to <hi>Cleante,</hi> that he had nothing that he could deny to my father. This was the cauſe, that after they had ſome daies ſeen how the young Knights, who were at the Feaſt, went attired, how they armed themſelues, and fought at the Barriers, and hauing ſhewed his minde to his friend <hi>Clindor,</hi> they both together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought <hi>Cleante,</hi> to giue them meanes, that they might ſhew themſelues among the other Knights. And how, ſaid <hi>Cleante</hi> to them, haue you the courage to equall your ſelues to them? And why not, ſaid <hi>Alcippe?</hi> haue I not as much arme and legge as they? But you haue not learned the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilities of the Towne. We haue not learned them, ſaid he, but they are not ſo hard, that they ſhould put vs out of hope to apprehend them ſoone enough; and me thinks there is not ſuch difference betweene theirs and ours, but we may readily change them. You haue not, ſaid he, beene vſed to Armes. We haue, replied he, courage enough to ſupply that want. And how, adioyned <hi>Cleante,</hi> would you leaue the Countrey life? And what, ſaid <hi>Alcippe,</hi> haue the woods to doe with men? and what can men learne in conuerſing with beaſts? But, anſwered <hi>Cleante,</hi> this will be no great pleaſure to you, to ſee your ſelues diſdained by the glorious Courtiers, which wil alwaies reproach you that you are ſhepheards. If it be a ſhame, ſaid <hi>Alcippe,</hi> to be a ſhepheard, we muſt be ſuch no more: if it be no ſhame, the reproach cannot be hurtfull: or if they diſ-eſteeme me for my name, I will ſtriue by my actions, to make my ſelfe eſteemed. In the end, <hi>Cleante</hi> ſeeing they were reſolued to leade other liues then their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But well, ſaid he, my children, ſince you haue taken this reſolution,

Therefore feare not that you ſhall be welcome among thoſe knights; the principall of which are of the ſame blood that you are. Theſe words ſerued for no other vſe, but to enflame them the more; for this knowledge bred in them a deſire to put their purpoſe to effect, without conſidering what might come of it; whether for the diſcommodities which that life brings, or for the diſpleaſure that the father of <hi>Alcippe</hi> and his kindred might conceiue. Afterword <hi>Cleante</hi> was at charge to prouide for all things neceſſary. They were both ſo well borne, that quickly they wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>During theſe Feaſts, which laſted two moneths, my father was beheld, as I told you, of a Lady, whoſe name I could neuer know: and becauſe he ſeldome was wanting in any thing that might make him beloued, ſhe was in ſuch ſort ouertaken, that ſhe inuented a ſleight good enough to bring about her intent. One day, as my father ſtood in the Temple at the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which they made for <hi>Amaſis,</hi> an old woman came neere him, and fayning to be at her prayers, ſhe ſaid twice or thrice, <hi>Alcippe, Alcippe,</hi> not looking on him. He hearing himſelfe named, was about to aske her, what ſhe would with him; but ſeeing her eyes turned another way, he thought ſhe ſpake to ſome other. She that perceiued he harkned, went on, <hi>Alcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe,</hi> it is to you I ſpeake, though I looke not vpon you: if you deſire to haue the beſt fortune that euer knight had in this Court, be betweene day and night at the great croſſe way, which leads to the place of the Palace, and there you ſhall know the reſt of me. <hi>Alcippe</hi> ſeeing her ſpeake in this manner, without looking on her, likewiſe ſayd, he would be there; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he failed not: for the euening approching, he went to the place aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, where he ſtaied not long, but the aged woman came to him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt hidden vnder a Taſtata that ſhe had on her head, and drawing him aſide, ſaid to him, Young man, thou art the moſt happy that liues, being beloued of the moſt faire, and moſt louely Lady in this Court, and with whom (if thou wilt promiſe that, that I ſhal demand of thee) at this houre I binde my ſelfe, to make thee inioy all contentment. The young <hi>Alcippe</hi> hearing this propoſition, asked who the Lady was. See, ſaid ſhee, the firſt thing that I would haue you promiſe me, is, not to inquire after her name,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177519:25"/>
and to keepe this fortune ſecret: the other, that you ſuffer me to couer your eyes, when I bring you where ſhe is. <hi>Alcippe</hi> ſayd to her, Not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after her name, and to keepe this affaire ſecret, I will willingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: but to blindfold mine eyes, I will neuer ſuffer. And what is it you feare (ſaid ſhe?) I feare nothing, anſwered <hi>Alcippe:</hi> but I will haue mine eyes at liberty. O young man, ſaid the old woman, that art yet to learne, why wilt thou procure the diſpleaſure of a perſon that ſo loues thee? and will not this diſpleaſe her, to deſire to know more of her, then ſhe would haue thee?</p>
                  <p>Beleeue me, make no difficulty, doubt nothing, what danger can it be to thee? Where is that courage that thy preſence promiſeth at the firſt ſight? Is it poſſible that a perill imagined, can make thee forſake an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red good? And ſeeing that he moued not, Curſed be the mother, ſaid ſhe, that made thee ſo faire, &amp; ſo little hardy; without doubt, both thy viſage and thy courage are more of the woman, then of that thou art. The young <hi>Alcippe</hi> could not heare, without laughing, theſe words of the old woman vttered in ſuch choler. In the end, after he had ſometime thought in himſelfe, what an enemy he might haue, &amp; finding that he now had none, he reſolued to go, prouided, ſhe would ſuffer him to carry his ſword, and ſo let her blind his eyes; and taking her by her garment, followed her whither ſhe would lead him.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be too long, Madam, if I ſhould tell you all the particularities of this night. So it was, that after many turnings, and hauing (it may be) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times paſſed one way, he found himſelfe in a chamber, where, his eyes yet bound, hee was vncloathed by the ſame woman, and laid in bed; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while after, came the Lady, that had ſent for him, &amp; comming neere him, vncaſed his eyes, becauſe there was no light in the chamber: But for all that he could do, he was not able to get one word from her: So that he roſe from her in the morning, without knowing who ſhe was; onely he iudged her faire, and yong: and an houre before day, ſhe that brought him, came to carry him backe, and lead him with the ſame ceremonies. From that day, they reſolued betweene them, that whenſoeuer hee was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne, he ſhould finde a ſtone at a certaine croſſe-way before day.</p>
                  <p>While theſe things thus paſſed, the father of <hi>Alcippe</hi> dies, ſo that he is now more Maſter of himſelfe, then he was wont to be; &amp; had not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>Amarillis</hi> bene, and his priuate intent, which he held, the loue which he bare to his ſhepheardeſſe, might haply haue called him backe into the woods: for the fauours of this vnknowne Lady could not put her out of his remembrance, that if the great gifts which he had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:177519:26"/>
of her, had not retained him in this practice, after the two or three firſt voyages he had retired, though it ſeemed, ſince that time, he was come into the fauour of <hi>Pimander</hi> and <hi>Amaſis.</hi> But for that a young heart can hardly keepe any thing hidden long, it fell out, that <hi>Clindor,</hi> his deare friend, ſeeing him ſpend more then of cuſtome, demanded of him, how he came by his meanes. Whereto, at the firſt, anſwering diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly, in the end he diſcouered all his fortune: and after, told him, that for all the Art he could vſe, he could neuer know who ſhe was. <hi>Clindor</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very curious, counſelled him to cut out ſome halfe a foot of the frindge of the bed; and in the day he ſhould reſort to the greateſt houſes which he might beſt ſuſpect, and there hee might know her, eyther by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or by the piece. This he did, and by this craft, my father had know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her that thus fauoured him. Yet he hath cloſely concealed her name, that neyther <hi>Clindor,</hi> nor any of his children could euer know it. But, the firſt time that he went thither after that, when he was about to riſe in the morning, he coniured her, that ſhe would no longer hide her ſelfe from him, that it was labour loſt, for he knew aſſuredly that ſhe was ſuch an one.</p>
                  <p>She hearing her ſelfe named, was about to ſpeake, yet held her peace, and ſtayed till the olde woman came: to whom, when <hi>Alcippe</hi> was riſen from the bed, ſhe vſed ſuch threatnings, thinking it was ſhe that diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered it, that this poore woman came trembling to my father, and ſware he deceiued himſelfe. He then laughing, told the craft he had vſed, and that it was the inuention of <hi>Clindor.</hi> She well eaſed with that which he had diſcouered, after a thouſand oaths to the contrary, returned to tell this to the Lady, who was riſen of her ſelfe, to heare their diſcourſe: and when ſhe knew, that <hi>Clindor</hi> was the inuenter, ſhe turned all her choller againſt him, eaſily pardoning <hi>Alcippe,</hi> whom ſhe could not hate; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, after that day, ſhe neuer ſent more for him. And becauſe a ſpirit offended hath nothing ſo ſweete as reuenge, this woman turned ſo of euery ſide, that ſhe wrought a quarrell againſt <hi>Clindor;</hi> for which he was enforced to combate with a couſin of <hi>Pimander,</hi> whom he ſlew; and though he were purſued, yet he ſaued himſelfe in <hi>Auverne,</hi> by the helpe of <hi>Alcippe.</hi> But <hi>Amaſis</hi> ſo wrought, that <hi>Alaricke,</hi> King of the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then at <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> ſent him priſoner to <hi>Vſſon,</hi> with commandement to his Officers, to deliuer him ouer into the hands of <hi>Pimander,</hi> who looked for nothing more, then to finde commodity to ſend for him, that he might put him to death. <hi>Alcippe</hi> left nothing vnattempted to procure his pardon; but all was in vaine: for he had too ſtrong a party againſt
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:177519:26"/>
him. Therefore, ſeeing the aſſured loſſe of his friend, he reſolued vpon any danger whatſoeuer, to ſaue him. There was at <hi>Vſſon</hi> (as I told you) a place ſo ſtrong, that it might ſeeme a folly to any other to vndertake to get him out; yet his friendſhip, that found nothing ſo difficult, as to liue without <hi>Clindor,</hi> was ſuch, as he made an aſſault to defeat them which were of <hi>Pimanders</hi> part. So, making ſhew to retire himſelfe as diſcontent, he went with twelue other, and one day of March, preſenting themſelues at the Port of the Caſtle, in the habite of clownes, and carrying vnder their garments, ſhort ſwords, and baskets on their armes, as men that went to ſell; I haue heard him ſay, there were three fortreſſes, one within another.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reſolute Peſants came to the vtmoſt, where few of the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots</hi> remayned; for the moſt part were gone downe to the baſe towne, to ſee the market, and to prouide themſelues of what was neceſſary for the garriſon. Being there, they offred their wares at ſo good a price, that (almoſt) all that were within, drew downe to buy. Then my father ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the occaſion good and fit, laying hold of the necke of him that kept the gate, thruſt his ſword into his body. And euery of his companions (at the ſame inſtant) did like him, and entring in, put the reſt to the edge of the ſword; and ſuddenly ſhutting the gate, they ranne to the priſons, where they found <hi>Clindor</hi> in a corner, and ſo many others, that they iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged (being armed) ſufficient to defeat the reſt of the garriſon. To make ſhort, I tell you Madame, that though by the allarme, the gates of the towne were ſhut, yet they got out, without the loſſe of a man, though the Gouernour (that in the end was ſlayne) made all the reſiſtance he could.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee <hi>Clindor</hi> ſaued, and <hi>Alaricke</hi> aduertiſed, that it was my father that had done this enterpriſe; whereof he was ſo much diſpleaſed, that he demanded iuſtice of <hi>Amaſis:</hi> and ſhe which would not loſe his amitie, was willing enough to content him, and ſent preſently to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend my father; but his friend gaue him ſuch aduertiſements, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſet his battell in order, he went out of this Countrey: and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt <hi>Alaricke</hi> more then is credible, went to put himſelfe to a Nation that but lately was entred into <hi>Gaule;</hi> and who being warrelike, ſeized on both the ſides of <hi>Roſue</hi> and <hi>Arar,</hi> and a good part of the <hi>Allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broges,</hi> and being deſirous to enlarge their bounds, they made continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all warre on the <hi>Viſigots, Ostrogots</hi> and <hi>Romanes.</hi> He was welcome with all thoſe whom he would conduct: and being knowne for a man of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, he was preſently honoured with diuers charges. But ſome yeeres
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:177519:27"/>
being paſſed, <hi>Gondioch</hi> king of this Nation comming to die, <hi>Gondebaut</hi> his ſonne ſucceeded to the Crowne of <hi>Bourgonny:</hi> and deſirous to aſſure his affayres, at the beginning made a peace with his neighbours, marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſonne <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> with one of the daughters of <hi>Theodoricke</hi> king of the <hi>Ostrogots:</hi> and to pleaſe <hi>Alaricke,</hi> who was infinitely offended with <hi>Alcippe,</hi> promiſed him to keepe him no longer with him. So that (with his leaue) he withdrew to another people, which on the ſide of <hi>Rhenes</hi> was ſeiſed of another part of <hi>Gaule,</hi> in deſpite of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> and of the <hi>Romanes.</hi> But this diſcourſe would be cumberſome to you, if particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly I ſhould recount all his voyages. For from them he was conſtrained to go to <hi>London,</hi> to the great King <hi>Arthur,</hi> who at the ſame time (as I haue heard him often tell) inſtituted the Order of the Knights of the Round Table.</p>
                  <p>From thence he was enforced to go to that Realme, which beares the name of <hi>Port du Gaulois:</hi> and in the end, being ſought for by <hi>Alaricke,</hi> he reſolued to paſſe the Sea, and to goe to <hi>Biſantium,</hi> where the Emperour gaue him charge of his Gallies. But becauſe the deſire of returning into our Countrey, is aboue all others, my father (though very great with theſe great Emperours) yet had nothing neerer his heart, then once more to ſee his owne chimnies ſmoke, where ſo often he had beene made a wanton; and it ſeemed Fortune gaue him a fit meane, when he leaſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for it. But I haue heard ſay ſometimes by our Druides, that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is delighted to turne on the other ſide, when the change is leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. <hi>Alaricke</hi> came to die, &amp; <hi>Thierry</hi> his ſonne ſucceeded him, who for that he had many brethren, had much to do to maintaine his eſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heeding the hatred of his father. And ſo deſirous to giue content to euery man (for Bounty and Liberality are the two louers that draw all loues to them) at the entrance to his reigne, he proclaimed a generall abolition of all offences done in his kingdome. See a good beginning to compaſſe the returne of <hi>Alcippe;</hi> yet might he not returne, becauſe <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander</hi> had not forgotten the iniury receiued: notwithſtanding, as the <hi>Viſigots</hi> were the cauſe of his baniſhment, ſo Fortune would haue them ſerue as the inſtrument of his calling backe. Some little time before (as I told you) <hi>Arthur</hi> king of great <hi>Brittaine</hi> had inſtituted the Knights of the Round Table, which was a certaine number of vertuous young men, obliged to go ſeeke aduentures, to puniſh euill doers, to do iuſtice to the oppreſſed, and maintaine the honour of Ladies.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Viſigots</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> which then abode in <hi>Pampal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ne,</hi> in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that, choſe out Knights, who were to go diuers wayes, to ſhew their
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177519:27"/>
force and helpe. It fell out, that at this time one of the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> after he had run thorow many cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tries, came to <hi>Marſellis,</hi> where hauing made his defiance accuſtomed, he ouercame many of <hi>Pimanders</hi> Knights, whoſe heads he cut off, and out of extreeme cruelty, for proofe of his valour, ſent them to a Lady, whom he ſerued in Spaine. Among others, <hi>Amarillis</hi> loſt an vncle, who like my father, vnwilling to abide the quiet of the country life, had followed the myſtery of armes: and becauſe that while hee was abroad, ſhe had beene curious to haue of ordinary ſome newes of him, by meanes of ſome yong boyes, which hee and ſhee had appointed for it, as ſoon as this miſ-hap was come to her knowledge, ſhe wrote to him, not in mind that he ſhould returne, but as acquainting him with her diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. Loue, which is neuer in a good ſoule, without repleniſhing it with a thouſand generous deſſignes, would not ſuffer my father to know, that <hi>Amarillis</hi> was offended with any man; but preſently he takes a reſolution to chaſtiſe this wrong: and ſo, with the leaue of the Emperour, came diſguiſed into the houſe of <hi>Cleante,</hi> who knowing his deliberation, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted many wayes to diuert him, but Loue had ſtronger perſwaſions then he. And in a morning, as <hi>Pimander</hi> was going to the Temple, <hi>Aloippe</hi> preſents himſelfe before him, armed throughout, &amp; though he had his vizard vp, yet was he not knowne for his beard, which grew ſince his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. When <hi>Pimander</hi> knew his reſolution, he made much of him, for the hatred he bare to this ſtranger, by reaſon of his arrogancy, and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and preſently cauſed the <hi>Viſigot</hi> to be aduertiſed by an Herauld of armes.</p>
                  <p>To make ſhort, my father ouer came him, and preſented the ſword to <hi>Pimander;</hi> and without the knowledge of any body, but <hi>Amarillis</hi> that ſaw him out of <hi>Cleantes</hi> houſe, he returned to <hi>Biſantum,</hi> where he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued as before. In this ſpace, <hi>Cleante,</hi> that deſired nothing more then to ſee him at liberty in Foreſts, diſcouered him to <hi>Pimander,</hi> who was very deſirous to know the name of him that fought with the ſtranger. He at the firſt aſtonyed, in the end moued with the vertue of this man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded if it were poſſible he ſhould be aliue? Whereto <hi>Cleante</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, recounting to him all his fortunes, and all his long voiages, &amp; in the end, what accompt he was of, with all the Kings whom he ſerued. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt (then ſayd <hi>Pimander)</hi> the vertue of this man merits to be eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and not to be baniſhed, beſides the great pleaſure he hath done me; Therefore let him returne, and aſſure himſelfe, that I will eſteeme of it, and loue him as he deſerues: And hence forth I pardon him all that he hath done againſt me. Thus my father, after he had ſtayed 17. yeres in Greece,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:177519:28"/>
came into his country, honored of <hi>Pimander</hi> and <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who gaue him the chiefe charge, that was about their perſons: But ſee what we are of our ſelues! One may delight him, with all things in aboundance, and the deſire ſatiated remaines without force. As ſoone as my father enioyed the fauours of fortune, as he could deſire, behold, he loſt the taſte, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained them. And then ſome good Angell, that was willing to draw him out of this gulph, where ſo often he was like to make ſhipracke, repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him (as I haue heard him ſay) theſe conſiderations: Come hither, <hi>Alcippe,</hi> what is thy deſire? Is it not to liue happily, ſo long as <hi>Clotho</hi> ſpins out thy life? If this be it, or thinkeſt thou to finde this good, but in quiet reſt, or it may be, out of affaires, how can they beare the ambition of the Court, ſince the happineſſe of ambition, is the multiplicity of affaires? Haſt not thou ſufficiently proued the inconſtancy whereof they are ſo full? at leaſt haue but this conſideration in thee: Thy ambition is to command many, euery of them hath the ſame deſire that thou haſt; theſe their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires propound the ſame wayes; going the ſame wayes, cannot they come to the ſame that thou art, and attaine it, ſince ambition is a place ſo ſtrait that it can hold but one alone, ſo that either you muſt oppoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a thouſand that will ſet on you, or elſe giue way to them? If thou oppoſe, what can bee thy quiet, ſince you are to haue an eye to your friends, and to your enemies, and that day and night their weapons are whetting againſt thee? If thou giue way to them, there is nothing ſo miſerable, as a country decayed. Then, <hi>Alcippe,</hi> come againe into thy ſelfe, and remember that thy fathers and grandfathers haue bene much wiſer then thou: be not more ſelfe willed, but fixe the diamond nayle at the wheele of this fortune, which thou haſt ſo often proued changeable: come backe to the place of thy birth, leaue this purple, and change it into thy former habits; let thy launce be turned into a ſheephook, thy ſword into a culter, to open the earth, and not the bellies of men; there ſhalt thou finde that repoſe, which for ſo many yeeres thou couldſt neuer haue elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>See, Madam, the conſiderations which led my father to his forme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r profeſſion. And thus, to the great aſtoniſhment of all, but with the great prayſes of the wiſer ſort, he came to his former eſtate, where hee cauſed our ancient ſtatutes to be renewed, with ſo good liking of all men, that he might ſay he was at the height of ambition, though he were impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueriſhed, ſince he was ſo well beloued, and honored of his neighbours, that they tooke him for an Oracle. And yet this was not the end of his paines: for being after the death of <hi>Pimander</hi> retired to himſelfe, hee had
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177519:28"/>
not beene long in our grounds, but Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>e renewes his old blowes, there being of al Loues arrowes, none ſharper then that of conuerſation. Then behold <hi>Amarillis</hi> ſo high in his thoughts, that ſhe gaue him more paine then all his former trauailes. It was at that time that he tooke againe the deuice which he had borne, during all his voyages of the Pen of a Iay, meaning to ſignifie <hi>Peinjay.</hi> Of this loue came great hatred; for <hi>Alce</hi> the father of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> was infinitely amorous of this <hi>Amarillis,</hi> and <hi>Amarillis,</hi> during my fathers exile, had permitted this ſuite by the commandement of her parents, and at this time ſhe cannot withdraw it, without ſo great trouble, that he is ready to deſpaire. On the other ſide, <hi>Alcippe,</hi> that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting off the habite of a knight, but had not left the courage, could not ſuffer a Riuall, came to handy ſtrokes manytimes with <hi>Alce,</hi> who wanted not courage: and a man may thinke, but for the parents of <hi>Amarillis,</hi> who reſolue to beſtow her on <hi>Alcippe,</hi> there had beene much miſchiefe betweene them. But though by this marriage they cut off the boughs of this quarrell; yet their hatred liued ſo, and grew ſo high, that there was neuer familiarity betweene <hi>Alce</hi> and <hi>Alcippe.</hi> And this is (ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> addreſſing himſelfe to <hi>Siluie)</hi> faire Nymph, which you heard them talke when you were in our hamlet; for I am the ſonne of <hi>Alcippe,</hi> and of <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillis,</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> is the daughter of <hi>Alce,</hi> and <hi>Hipolite.</hi> It may be, you may thinke it ſtrange, that not parting from our woods and paſtures, I know ſo many particulars of the neighbour Countries. But, Madame, all that I haue learned, was but from my father, who recounting vnto me his life, hath beene driuen withall, to tell me the things you haue heard.</p>
                  <p>So ended <hi>Celadon</hi> his diſcourſe, and indeed, not without paine, for ſpeaking hurt him much, hauing his ſtomake as yet diſtempered: and this was the cauſe that he recounted the Hiſtory much ſhorter then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could. But <hi>Galathes</hi> reſted more ſatisfied then he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for that ſhe knew of what Anceſtors this ſhepheard was deſcended, whom ſhe loued.</p>

What deſpaires preſented not themſelues to him? None that Loue might bring forth, eſpecially to a loue ſo hopeleſſe. For if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the vniuſt ſentence of his Miſtriſſe, he oppoſed his innocency, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly the execution of the arreſt came before his eyes. And as hee fell out of one thought into another, his hand, by chance, touched the ribon where <hi>Aſtreas</hi> ring was, which he had wound about his arme. Oh! what deadly remembrances came into his ſpirit? He repreſented to himſelfe all the anger, which at that inſtant ſhe had painted in her face; all the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty his ſoule could inuent, both by words and actions, and all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines, with which ſhe had pronounced the award of his baniſhment.</p>
               <p>Staying ſomewhile on that laſt miſchance, he began to remember the change of his fortune, how happy hee had beene, how highly ſhee had fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured him, and how long it had laſted; from that hee came, to what ſhe had done for him; how for his ſake ſhe had ſcorned diuers honeſt ſhepheards; what ſmall reckoning ſhe made of her fathers will; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of her mother; and the difficulties, which aroſe againſt their loues: then he went on, bethinking himſelfe, that the fortunes of Loue
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:177519:29"/>
are more aſſured then of other things, and what a little remained to him of ſo many fauours, which at laſt came but to one bracelet of haire which he had on his arme, and a little picture which he hung at his necke, the caſe whereof he often kiſſed: as for the ring which he had on his other arme, he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued that rather of force, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good wil, ſhe gaue him that. But then, at that inſtant he remembred the letters ſhee had written to him, during his good fortune, and which he bare ordinarily about him, in a bag of ſilke. Oh! how great was his anguiſh? for he feared, that the Nymphs ſearching his clothes, had found it. In this doubt hee cals lowd vpon little <hi>Merill,</hi> for he was lodged in a Wardrobe hard by, to attend him. The boy hearing him call twice or thrice, came to know what hee would. My little friend (ſaid <hi>Celadon)</hi> knoweſt thou not what are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of my clothes? for I haue ſomething thereabout, that I would be ſorry to loſe. Your clothes (ſaid he) are not farre off, but there is nothing in them: for I haue ſearched them.</p>
               <p>Ah, ſaid the ſhepheard, thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe, <hi>Merill,</hi> I haue ſomething there that I had rather keepe then my life; and then turning on the other ſide the bed, begun to bewaile and torment himſelfe ſome good while. <hi>Merill,</hi> that heard him, one way, was loth to diſpleaſe him; and on the other, ſtood in doubt, whether hee ſhould tell him what hee knew. In the end, not being able to ſuffer to ſee him any longer in this paine, he told him he need not ſo much diſquiet himſelfe, and that the Nymph <hi>Galathee</hi> loued him too wel, not to reſtore him the thing he made ſhew to be ſo deſirous of. Then <hi>Celadon</hi> turning towards him, And how (ſaith he) hath the Nymph that which I demand? I beleeue (ſaid he) it is the ſame. At leaſt, I found nothing but a little bag full of papers; and as I was about to haue brought them before you ſlept, ſhe ſpyed them, and tooke them from me. O Lord, then (ſaid the ſhepheard) all things fall out the worſt they may; and turning on the other ſide, would talke to him no more. In this meane time had <hi>Galathee</hi> read the letters of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon:</hi> for it was true that ſhe had taken them from <hi>Merill,</hi> following the ordinary curioſity of them which loue: But ſhe had ſtraitly charged him to ſay nothing, becauſe ſhe had a purpoſe to giue him the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but he ſhould not know ſhe had ſeene them. At that time <hi>Siluie</hi> carried a light before, and <hi>Leonide</hi> was ſomewhere elſe, and of neceſſity, now ſhee was to bee of counſell. We ſhall ſee (ſaid <hi>Siluie)</hi> if this ſhepheard be the merchant he would ſeeme to be, and if he be not amorous: for I aſſure my ſelfe, theſe papers will tell tales, and then ſet it on the table. By this had <hi>Galathee</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done the ſtring, which was ſo well tied, that the water had done no hurt;
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:177519:30"/>
yet there were ſome papers wet, which ſhe drew out as leaſurely as ſhee could, leſt ſhe might teare them, and hauing ſpred them on the table, the firſt ſhe layd her hand on, was a letter in this ſort:</p>
               <p>What is it you vndertake, <hi>Celadon?</hi> into what confuſion goe you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to thruſt your ſelfe? Beleeue mee that counſell you like a friend; giue ouer your deſſigne to doe me ſeruice: it is too full of diſcommodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. What contentment hope you for? I am ſo inſupportable, that you were as good vndertake a thing impoſſible; you muſt ſerue, you muſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, you muſt haue neither eyes nor loue, but for me; for thinke not that I will haue part with any other, nor that I will receiue a good will that is but halfe mine. I am ſuſpitious, I am iealous, I am hard to be wonne, and eaſie to be loſt; ſoone offended, but very hardly appeaſed; the leaſt doubt in me, is aſſurance. My will muſt be as the Deſtinies, my opinions as from reaſon, and my commandements lawes inuiolable. Beleeue me, for this once, retyre thy ſelfe, ſhepheard, from this dangerous Labyrinth, and flie from a deſſigne ſo curious. I know my ſelfe better then you do: do not you imagine in your ſelfe, that in the end you can change my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; I ſhall breake ſooner then bend. And do not you heereafter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playne of me, if now you beleeue not what I tell you.</p>
               <p>Neuer thinke me to be that I am (ſayd <hi>Galathee)</hi> if this ſhepheard be not in loue; for ſee a beginning which is not ſmall. There is no doubt (ſayd <hi>Siluie)</hi> being ſo honeſt a man. And how (replyed <hi>Galathee)</hi> are you of opinion, that he muſt of neceſſity loue, being ſo? Yes, Madam, (ſayd ſhe) as I haue heard them ſay, Becauſe that the louer deſireth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then to be beloued; to be beloued, he muſt ſhew himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable: and that which makes a man amiable, is that which makes him honeſt. At this word <hi>Galathee</hi> gaue her another letter, which was wet, to dry at the fire, and in the meane time ſhe tooke another, which was thus:</p>
               <p>You will not beleeue that I loue you, but deſire that I ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue you loue me: if I loue you not, what will you gaine by the beliefe which I haue of your affection? It may be this opinion may binde me to do ſo. Hardly, <hi>Celadon,</hi> would this weake conſideration effect it, if your merits and ſeruices which I haue receiued of you, had not already done it. Now, behold in what ſtate your affayres are, I would you ſhould not onely know that I beleeue you loue me; but moreouer, I will that you aſſure your ſelfe, that I loue you. And among other things, one onely ſhould make it vnqueſtionable: if I loued you not, what would make me neglect the contentment of my parents? If you conſider how much I doe

owe them, you may (in ſome ſort) know the quality of my loue, ſince it not onely counterpoyſes, but weighs downe ſo great a weight. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and be no more incredulous.</p>
               <p>By this time <hi>Siluie</hi> brought backe the letter, and <hi>Galathee</hi> told her (with great griefe) that he loued, and more, that he was infinitely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued, and read the letter to her agayne, which ſtrucke her to the heart, ſeeing ſhe was to aſſault that place where ſo ſtrong an enemy was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready victorious: for by thoſe letters ſhe iudged that the humour of this ſhepheardeſſe was not to be an halfe Miſtris, but with a right abſolute power commaunded ouer thoſe, whom ſhe vouchſafed to entertaine for hers: ſhe liked well of this iudgement; when ſhe read the letter that had beene dryed, it was thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Licidas</hi> told my <hi>Phillis,</hi> that yeſterday you were in a naughty humor; am I the cauſe, or you? if I, it is without cauſe: for would not I alwaies loue you, and be beloued of you? And, haue you not a thouſand times ſworne to me, that you deſire but this, to be content: if you, then you doe me wrong, to diſpoſe, without my knowledge, of any thing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth vnto me; for by the donation which you haue made, and which I haue receiued, both your ſelfe, and all that is yours, doe appertayne to me. Aduertiſe me then, and I ſhall foorthwith perceiue whether I may giue you permiſſion: but in the meane ſeaſon, take this as a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding.</p>
               <p>With what empery (ſayd then <hi>Galathee)</hi> doth this ſhepheardeſſe deale? She doth him no wrong (anſwered <hi>Siluie)</hi> ſince ſhe gaue him warning from the beginning; and without fiction, if it be ſhe that I thinke, ſhe hath ſome reaſon, being one of the moſt faire, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete perſons that euer I ſaw. Her name is <hi>Astrea,</hi> and that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me thinke ſo, is this word of <hi>Phillis,</hi> knowing that theſe two ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes are ſworne friends: and yet, as I may tell you, though ſhe be ſo extreme faire, yet this is that that makes her leaſt amiable; for ſhee hath ſo many other perfections, that this is leaſt apparent in her. This diſcourſe ſerued but to wound the deeper, ſince they diſcouered nothing but the greateſt difficulties in her diſſigne. And becauſe ſhe would not that <hi>Siluie</hi> as then ſhould know, ſhe ſhut vp the papers, and went to bed, not without a great company of ſundry thoughts, among which, ſleepe came ſtealing by little and little.</p>
               <p>It was hardly day, when the little <hi>Merill</hi> went out of the ſhepheards chamber, who had complayned all night, and his trauell and his ſicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe had but little aſſwagement till the comming of the morning. And
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:177519:31"/>
becauſe <hi>Galathee</hi> had commaunded him to marke particularly whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer <hi>Celadon</hi> did, and to repeate it to her, he went to tell her what he had learned. At that time <hi>Galathee</hi> being awaked, talked ſo loude with <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide,</hi> that <hi>Merill</hi> hearing them knocking at the doore, Madame (quoth he) all this night could I not ſleepe, for the poore <hi>Celadon</hi> is almoſt dead, by reaſon of the papers which you tooke from me yeſterday; and becauſe I ſawe him very deſperate, I was conſtrained to giue him ſome eaſe, by telling him you had them. How? (ſayes the Nymph) knoweth he that I haue them? Yes certainely, Madam (anſwered <hi>Merill,)</hi> and I aſſure my ſelfe, he will intreate you to reſtore them; for he eſteemeth them very dearely: and if you had heard him, as I did, I doubt not but he would make you pitty him. Ah! tell me, <hi>Merill</hi> (ſayd the Nymph) what he ſaid. Madame (ſayd he) after he had asked, if I had not ſeene his papers, and that in the end he knew you had them, he turned like a man tranſported on the other ſide, and ſayd: Now all things fall out the worſt they may: and after he had beene ſilent ſome while, and that he thought I was in my bed, I heard him ſigh very loude, and after vttered theſe words: <hi>Astrea, Aſtrea,</hi> ought theſe baniſhments to be the recompence of my ſeruices? If your loue be changed, why doe you blame me, to excuſe your ſelfe? If I haue failed, why tell you me not my fault? Is there no more iuſtice in heauen, then there is pitty in your ſoule? Alas! if there be, why feele not I ſome fauour, that hauing no power to die, as deſpaire will haue me, I may do ſo at leaſt as the rigor of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> commands? Ha rigorous! If I may not call it cruell commaundement in ſuch an accident as this, who could take a leſſe reſolution then that of death? would it not giue ſigne of leſſe loue, then of great courage? And here ſtaying a while, he thus beganne againe:</p>
               <p>But wherefore (my traiterous hopes) come you flattering to me? is it poſſible you ſhould dare to come neere me? doe you ſay ſhe will change? Conſider then (enemy of my repoſe) what likelihoode is there, that ſo much time ſpent, ſo many ſeruices and affections acknowledged, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſdaynes borne vp, and impoſſibilities ouercome, haue done ſo little, and yet onely abſence may? Hope rather for a fauourable tombe at thy death, then a fauourable repentance from her. After many ſuch diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, he held his peace a great while: but when I was gone backe, I heard him ſhortly after beginne agayne his complaints, which he held on vntill day; and all that I could obſerue, was but his complaints which he made againſt one <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whom he accuſed of change and cruelty.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Galathee</hi> had knowne leſſe of <hi>Celadons</hi> affayres by the letters of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea,</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:177519:31"/>
ſhe had learned ſo much from the report of <hi>Merill,</hi> that for her own reſt, it had beene good for her to haue beene more ignorant. Yet in flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering her ſelfe, ſhe conceited to her ſelfe, that the diſdayne of <hi>Astrea</hi> might make the way more eaſie to that which ſhe deſired. Young Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in loue! that knowes not that Loue neuer dies in a generous heart, till the roote be wholy pluckt vp. In this hope ſhe wrote a little ſcroule, which ſhe folded vp, and put among the papers of <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> After, giuing the bagge to <hi>Merill:</hi> Hold heere (ſayd ſhe) <hi>Merill:</hi> reſtore this bagge to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and tell him, I would I were able to giue him all the content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he wants; that if he be well, and would ſee me, tell him that I am not well this morning. She ſaid this, that he might haue leiſure to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look his papers, and reade that which ſhe had written to him. <hi>Merill</hi> went foorth; and becauſe <hi>Leonide</hi> was in an other bed, ſhe could neyther ſee the bagge, nor heare the charge which ſhe had giuen him: but as ſoone as he was gone, ſhe called her, and made her come to bed to her: and after ſome other talke, ſhe ſpake in this ſort to her: You know, <hi>Leonide,</hi> what I told you yeſterday of this ſhepheard, how much it importeth me that he loue me, or that he not loue me; ſince that time I haue vnderſtood of his buſineſſes, more then I would I had: you haue heard that which <hi>Merill</hi> hath reported to me, and that which <hi>Siluie</hi> ſaid of the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> ſo that (ſhe went on) ſince the place is taken, I ſee a double difficulty ariſe againſt our enterpriſe.</p>
               <p>This happy ſhepheardeſſe hath much offended him, and a generous heart will hardly ſuffer a diſdaine without any ſence of it. Madam, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> on the one ſide, I wiſh you were contented: and on the other, I am well pleaſed with the diſco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modities, for you do your ſelfe ſo much wrong, if you continue thus, that I know not if euer you can deface it. Thinke you, though you be neuer ſo ſecret, that this life of yours will not bee knowne? and what will become of you, if it be diſcouered? the iudgement which was neuer wanting in the reſt of your actions, is it poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile that in this accident it ſhould faile you? what would you iudge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, that ſhould lead this life? You will anſwer, you do no euill. Ah, Madam, it is not ſufficient for a perſon of your quality to bee voyd of crime, but you be ſo alſo of blame. If this were a man worthy of you, I could brook it wel: but though <hi>Celadon</hi> be one of the chiefe of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, yet is he but a ſhepheard, and is knowne for no other: And this vaine opinion of good, or ill lucke, ſhall it haue ſuch power ouer you, that it ſhall ſo much abate your courage, that you will equall theſe keepers of ſheepe, theſe Ruſticks, and theſe halfe-Sauages, to yourſelfe? for Gods

ſake come to your ſelfe, and conſider with what minde I ſpeake theſe words. She had gone forward, had not <hi>Galathee</hi> in choler interrupted her, I haue told you, I would not haue you vſe this diſcourſe: I know not on what I ſhall reſolue: when I aske your counſell, giue it me, and once for al, talke no more to me of it, if you will not diſpleaſe me.</p>
               <p>At this word, ſhe turned on the other ſide, in ſuch furie, that <hi>Leonide</hi> knew well ſhe had throughly angred her. Indeed there is nothing ſtrikes more to the quicke, then to oppoſe honor againſt Loue: for though all the reaſons of Loue be vanquiſhed, yet will Loue ſtil be ſtrong in his will. Soone after, <hi>Galathee</hi> turnes againe and ſayes: I neuer thought, till now, that you had had a minde to be my gouernor: but now, I begin to haue ſuch a beliefe, that you figure ſuch a thing to your ſelfe. Madam, anſwered ſhe, I neuer miſtooke my ſelfe ſo much, but I know what I owe to you: but ſince you take in ſo ill part, that which my duty made me ſpeake, I proteſt from henceforth, I will neuer giue you occaſion for this cauſe, to enter into choler againſt me. This is a ſtrange thing in you, replied <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathee,</hi> that you muſt alwayes haue reaſon in your opinion: what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is there, that any ſhould know that <hi>Celadon</hi> is here? There are no more then we three, <hi>Merill</hi> &amp; my Nurſe his mother: as for <hi>Merill,</hi> he goes not forth: and beſides he hath diſcretion enough for his age; for my Nurſe, her fidelity is well knowne to me, and it is partly by her deſire, that all is thus carried: for as hauing told her what the Druide foretold me, ſhe that loues me more tenderly, then if I were her owne child, counſelled me not to contemne this aducrtiſement: and becauſe I propounded the difficulty of the great number, which would reſort to the place where I am, her ſelfe aduiſed me to make ſhewe, that I would take phiſicke. And what is your purpoſe, ſayd <hi>Leonide?</hi> To worke ſo (anſwered ſhe) that this ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard may wiſh me well, and till that be, not to let him go away; that if once he come to loue me, I may leaue the direction of the reſt to Fortune.</p>
               <p>Madame, ſayd <hi>Leonide,</hi> God giue you all the contentment you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. But ſuffer me to tell you this once, you go about to ruine your ſelfe in your reputation. What time muſt there bee to the rooting out of an affection ſo thorowly grounded, which he beares to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whoſe beauty and vertue, they ſay, is without a ſecond? But preſently interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Nymph, She ſcornes him, ſhe is angry with him, ſhe hath driuen him away: thinke you not, he will haue courage enough to leaue her? Oh! Madam, put this out of your hopes (ſaid <hi>Leonide:)</hi> if he haue no corage<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he will neuer feele this: and if he haue, a man generous will neuer turne aſide for the difficulties. Remember your ſelfe, for example, how many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts

haue you layd on <hi>Lindamer,</hi> and how cruelly haue you handled him, and what hath he done the leſſe, for theſe diſdaines, or cruelties. But be it ſo, that <hi>Celadon,</hi> becauſe he is a ſhepheard, haue not the courage of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and that he hath bentat the blowes of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> what good hope you there of? thinke you that a ſpirit once deceiued, will eaſily be deceiued the ſecond time in one kind? No, no, Madam, howſoeuer he be both by birth &amp; conuerſation of the homelier ſort, yet can he not be ſo, but he wil dread the fire when the ſmart of it is yet in his ſoule. There muſt be (and that is it which you may beſt hope for) ſome time allowed to heale him ſoundly of this burning, before he can turne his eyes vpon ſome ſuch like obiect. And what time will it aske? and in the meane time can it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to let, but that the gard which is in the baſe court, will come to the knowledge of it, or in ſeeing him (for you cannot alwaies keepe him cloſe in one chamber) or by the prattle of <hi>Merill,</hi> who as diſcreet as he is for his age, yet is but a child? <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid ſhee, ceaſe to trauell longer in this buſineſſe; my reſolution is ſuch as I told you: if you wil make me beleeue you loue me, fauour my deſigne in what you may, and for the reſt, referre it to my care. This morning, if the weakeneſſe of <hi>Celadon</hi> permit it (mee thought yeſterday he was reaſonable well) you may lead him into the garden; for this day I finde my ſelfe not well, and I ſhall hardly riſe out of my bed, tell towards night. <hi>Leonide</hi> being very ſad, gaue no other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, but that ſhe would be ready to do that, that might be to her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. While they were thus diſcourſing, <hi>Meril</hi> did his meſſage, and hauing found the ſhepheard awake, gaue him the good morrow, in the name of the Nymph, and preſented to him the papers. Oh! how preſently he raiſed himſelfe in the bed? he made him open the curtaines, and windowes, not hauing the leaſure to riſe, ſuch haſte he made to ſee that, which had coſt him ſo much ſorrow. Hee opened the little bag, and after hee had many times kiſſed it; O ſecretary (ſaid he) of my life moſt happy, how cameſt thou into the hands of ſtrangers! At this word he layd all the letters on the bed; &amp; that he might ſee if he wanted any one, he placed them in their order according to the time he receiued them, and ſeeing there remained a little ſcrowle, he opened it and read theſe words:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>CEladon, <hi>I would have you know, that</hi> Galathee <hi>loues you, and that the heauens haue permitted the diſdaine of</hi> Aſtrea, <hi>for that they like not, that a ſhepheardeſſe ſhould any longer poſſeſſe that which a Nymph deſires: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your good hap, and refuſe it not.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:177519:33"/>
The aſtoniſhment of the ſhepheard was great: notwithſtanding, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Merill</hi> obſerued his actions, he would make no ſhew of it. Then locking them againe together, and lying downe in his bed, he asked who gaue them to him? I tooke them (ſaid he) out of my Ladyes deske; and but for the deſire I had to put you out of the paine wherein I ſaw you, I durſt not haue gone for them, for that ſhe is not well at eaſe. And who is with her (demanded <hi>Celadon?)</hi> The two Nymphs which you ſaw yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, where of the one is <hi>Leonide,</hi> the Niece of <hi>Adamas,</hi> the other is <hi>Siluie,</hi> the daughter of <hi>Diante</hi> the glorious: and indeed, ſhe is not his daughter, without reaſon; for ſhee is the moſt lofty in her behauiour that you ſhall lightly ſee.</p>
               <p>So receiued <hi>Celadon</hi> the firſt aduertiſement of the good will of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee,</hi> for though there were neither cipher nor ſeale to the ſcroule hee had receiued, yet iudged he that it would not haue beene done without her knowledge. And then he fore-ſaw that this would be a ſurcharge to his ſorrowes, and that he muſt vndergoe it. Seeing then, that halfe of the day was almoſt paſſed, and finding himſelfe in good caſe, he would keepe no longer in bed; thinking, that the ſooner he left it, the ſooner he might take his leaue of theſe faire Nymphs. And being riſen in this deliberation, as he was ready to goe out to walke, he met with <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Siluie,</hi> whom <hi>Galathee</hi> (not daring to riſe, nor yet ſhew her ſelfe to him, for ſhame of the ſcroule ſhe had writ) had ſent to giue him entertainment. They went downe into the garden: And becauſe <hi>Celadon</hi> would hide his ſorrow, he ſhewed a countenance as pleaſant as he could diſſemble: and ſeeming to be curious to know euery thing he ſaw, Faire Nymphs (ſaid he to them) is it not heereabout that the Fountaine of the truth of Loue is? I am very willing, if it be poſſible, to ſee it. It is hard by, anſwered the Nymph, for wee muſt goe downe but this great Wood. But it is impoſſible to ſee it, and you muſt thanke this faire that is the cauſe, poynting to <hi>Siluie.</hi> I know not (replyed ſhe) why you accuſe me: For, for my part, I neuer heard the ſword blamed which cut the foole that laid his finger vnder it. It is true, anſwered <hi>Leonide:</hi> but if I be not deceiued, that which wounds, and your beauty, are not in the number of thoſe, that are ſeene without homicide. Such as it is (anſwered <hi>Siluie,</hi> with a little bluſhing) it hath lynes ſtrong enow, euer to let that goe, that it hath once tyed vp.</p>
               <p>She ſaid this vpbrayding her with the infidelity of <hi>Agis,</hi> who hauing ſomtimes loued her, for aielouſie, or for an abſence of two months, was entirely changed: and for <hi>Polemas,</hi> whom another beauty had robbed her of, the which ſhe vnderſtood well enough. So I confeſſe, my ſiſter, replyed
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177519:33"/>
ſhe, my lines are eaſie to ſlide, but that is, becauſe I would neuer take the paine to ſtiffen them. <hi>Celadon</hi> hearing, with great pleaſure, their prety diſputation, that they might not breake off too ſoone, he ſayd to <hi>Siluie,</hi> Faire Nymph, ſince from you the difficulty proceedes, of ſeeing this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Fountain, we ſhall a little be obliged vnto you, if from your ſelfe we know how this fell out. <hi>Celadon,</hi> anſwered the Nymph, ſomewhat ſmiling, You haue buſineſſe enough of your owne, without need to ſearch into any other: yet if curioſity can haue any place in your loue, this prattler <hi>Leonide,</hi> if you requeſt her, will tell you the end, ſince without any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe hath ſo well told the beginning. Siſter, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> your beauty makes all them to ſpeake much better that diſcourſe of it: and ſince you giue me leaue to tell of one effect the world ſhould take know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of, yet leſt we too much ſhould trouble the ſhepheard, I wil abridge for this bout as much as I can poſſibly. Not for that, interrupted the ſhepheard, but to giue leaſure to this Nymph, to yeeld you the like. Make no doubt of that, replied <hi>Siluie,</hi> but according to her vſage of mee, I ſhall ſee what I haue to doe. So what by the one, and what by the other, <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon</hi> ſhall learne from their owne mouth, their life in particular: and that in the deliuery he might better heare them, they placed him betweene them, and walking a ſoft pace, <hi>Leonide</hi> beganne in this manner:</p>
               <div type="part">
                  <head>
                     <hi>The Hiſtory of</hi> Siluie.</head>
                  <p>THey that ſay, that to be beloued, there needes nothing but to loue, haue not tryed it neither in the eyes, nor courage of this Nymph, otherwiſe they were to know, that as the water of the Fountaine runs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly from the ſpring, ſo the Loue which riſes from this faire, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders from her as farre as it can. If when you haue heard the diſcourſe which I am to make to you, you will not auerre that that I ſay, I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling you ſhould accuſe me of ſmall iudgement.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amaſis,</hi> the mother of <hi>Galathee,</hi> hath a ſonne, named <hi>Clidamon,</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with all the amiable vertues, that a perſon of his age and quality may haue; for he ſeemeth to be borne to all that pertaine to Armes or Ladyes. It is about three yeeres ſince, that to giue ſome proofe of his gentle nature, with the permiſſion of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> he became ſeruant to al the Nymphs, and that not by election, but by lot: For, hauing put all the names of the Nymphs into a veſſell, and all the young Knights into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before all the aſſembly he tooke the youngeſt among vs, and the youngeſt among them; to the man he gaue the veſſell of the Nymphs, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:177519:34"/>
to the mayd, that of the men. And then after the ſound of the trumpets, the Youth drew, and the firſt name that came out, was <hi>Siluie:</hi> and the ſame inſtant the lot was drawne by the youngeſt Nymph, who drew that of <hi>Clidamon.</hi> Great was the applauſe of euery one, but greater the gentleneſſe of <hi>Clidamon,</hi> who after he had receiued the ſcroule, came with one knee on the ground, to kiſſe the hands of this faire Nymph, who out of ſhamefaſtneſſe would not ſuffer him, without the commandement of <hi>Amaſis;</hi> who ſaid, it was the leaſt part of ſeruice that was due vnto her, in the honour of ſo great a god as Loue. After her all the reſt were called: to ſome it fell out as they deſired, to others not: ſo it was, that <hi>Galathee</hi> had a moſt accompliſhed perſon, named <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who as then was but lately come from the Army of <hi>Meroue.</hi> As for mine, he was called <hi>Agis,</hi> the moſt inconſtant and deceitfull that euer was.</p>
                  <p>Now of thoſe that were thus beſtowed, ſome ſerued onely in ſhew, others of good will, ratified to theſe faire the deuotion which fortune had made of them: and they that maintained themſelues beſt, were ſuch as before had conceiued ſome affection. Among others, the yong <hi>Ligda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was one; this man fell to <hi>Siluie,</hi> a Nymph indeed amiable enough, but not for him, who had formerly ſet his mind otherwhere. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, it was his good fortune to bee abſent then, for hee would neuer haue done the fained homage to <hi>Siluie</hi> that <hi>Amaſis</hi> commanded, and that might haply haue wrought him ſome diſgrace: for you muſt know, (gentle ſhepheard) that he was brought vp very young among vs, being not aboue ten yeeres of age, when he was placed heere; for the reſt, ſo faire &amp; direct in all his actions, that there was not a woman that thought not well of him: and aboue all, <hi>Siluie</hi> being very neere his age. At the beginning, their ordinary conuerſation ingendred the amity of a brother to a ſiſter, ſuch as their knowledge was capable to receiue. By degrees, as <hi>Ligdamon</hi> grew in age, ſo likewiſe he encreaſed in affection, ſo that his childhood changing into a ſtate more ſettled, about the age of foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene or fifteene yeeres, he beganne to change his will into deſires, and by little and little, his deſires into paſſions: and yet he liued with that diſcretion, that <hi>Siluie</hi> had neuer knowledge that her ſelfe cauſed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. When he attained to ſome good vnderſtanding, and that he knew his euill, he iudged within a while, what ſmall hope there was of healing, not one of <hi>Siluies</hi> humours being likely to be hid from him: So that the ioy and liuelineſſe which was in his countenance, and all his actions, were turned into ſadneſſe, and his ſadneſſe into ſo heauy a melancholy, that there was no body but might perceiue the alteration. <hi>Siluie</hi> was not one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177519:34"/>
of the laſt that asked him the cauſe, but ſhe could draw out nothing but broken anſwers. In the end, ſeeing him continue ſtill in this manner of life, one day when ſhe beganne to complayne of his ſmall amity, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching him that ſhe had obliged her to conceale nothing from her, ſhe heard that he was no more able to reſtraine himſelfe, but that a deepe ſigh eſcaped from him in ſtead of anſwer. This brought her to be of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that loue might be the cauſe of his euill. And, ſee, if the poore <hi>Ligda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> did not diſcreetly carry his actions, ſince ſhe was neuer able to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine her ſelfe to be the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>I beleeue well, that the humour of this Nymph (which ſhrunke not a iot from this purpoſe) might be, in part, the occaſion. For hardly do we thinke of a thing eſtranged from our owne intents. But, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, that heerein his wiſedome was great, and his coldneſſe alſo, that it could ſo wholy couer the heate of his affection. She then preſſed him more then before, that if it be loue, ſhe promiſed him all the aſſiſtance, and all the good offices that might be hoped for from their amitie. The more he did to auoyde it, the more ſhe deſired to know it: in the end, not being able to defend it any longer, he proteſted to her, it was loue: but he had made an oath neuer to name the party. For (ſayd he) to loue, is a great preſumption in me; but conſtrayned by ſo many beauties, it may be excuſed: and to dare name her, what excuſe can couer the diſcouery of my raſhneſſe? Is this the friendſhip (preſently anſwered <hi>Siluie)</hi> which you beare me? Truly (replyed <hi>Ligdamon)</hi> I haue done it, and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement alſo, which I beſeech you ſet before your eyes, and this glaſſe, which will make you ſee what you deſire to know. At that word he tooke vp that which hung at her girdle, and held it before her eyes. Think you how ſhe was ſurpriſed, incontinently knowing what he would ſay; and ſhe hath ſince ſworne to me, that ſhe thought at firſt it had beene <hi>Galathee,</hi> of whom he would haue ſpoken. In the meane time that he had ſtood to behold her, ſhe ſtood as rauiſhed to conſider his ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in choller againſt him, but much more againſt her ſelfe, ſeeing well ſhe had drawne this declaration by force from his mouth. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, her high courage would not ſuffer her to make any long defence for the luſtice of <hi>Ligdamon.</hi> For at an inſtant ſhe lifts her ſelfe vp, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking to him, departs full of deſpite, that any durſt preſume to loue her arrogant beauty, that iudgeth none worthy of it. The faithfull <hi>Ligdamon</hi> ſtayed, but without a ſoule, and as an inſenſible Statue. In the end, comming agayne to himſelfe, he went as well as he could, to his lodging out of which he went not ſome good time, becauſe the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:177519:35"/>
which he had of the ſmall loue of <hi>Siluie</hi> touched him ſo to the quick, that he fell ſicke, ſo that there was ſmall hope of life, when he reſolued to write her ſuch a letter.</p>
                  <p>The loſſe of my life was not of force ſufficient to diſcouer vnto you the raſhneſſe of your ſeruant, without your expreſſe commandement; yet, if you iudge that I muſt die and hold my peace, ſay alſo, that your eyes muſt haue had leſſe abſolute power ouer me. For if at the firſt ſummons which their beauty made me, I could not defend my ſelfe from giuing them my ſoule, how hauing beene ſo often vrged, could I haue refuſed the acknowledgement of that gift? yet, if I haue offended in offering my heart to your beauty, I am willing, for the fault I haue committed, in preſenting to ſuch merits, a thing of ſo ſmall valew, to ſacrifice vnto you my life, without ſorrowing for the loſſe, eyther of the one, or of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſith they be no more pleaſing vnto you.</p>
                  <p>This letter was brought to <hi>Siluie,</hi> when ſhe was alone in her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. It is true, that I came in at the ſame time, and indeed well for <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damon;</hi> for behold the humour of this fayre Nymph: She had conceiued ſo great a deſpite toward him, after he had diſcouered his affection, that not only ſhe blotted out the remembra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the amity paſſed, but ſo loſt her will, that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was like a thing indifferent to her. So that, when ſhe heard that euery one deſpaired of his recouery, ſhe was no more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued at it, then if ſhe had neuer ſeene him. I, that particularly obſerued it, could not tell what to iudge of it, but that her youth made her eaſily loſe the loue of men abſent. But when now I ſaw her refuſe that which one deliuered her in his behalfe, I knew well that they needed no bad meſſenger between them. This was the cauſe that I took the letter that ſhe had refuſed, and which the young boy that brought it (by his maſters commaundement) had left on the table. She then leſſe heedfull then ſhe would haue beene, ranne after me, and intreated me not to reade it. I will ſee it (ſayd I) and it be but for the deniall you make. Then beganne ſhe to bluſh, and ſaid, Reade it not, good ſiſter, binde me to you for it, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure you by our friendſhip. And what ſhall that be then (anſwered I) if it may ſuffer you to conceale any thing from me? Thinke you, that if it allow you diſſimulation enough to hide from me, it ſhall not giue me cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity enough to diſcouer you. And how then (ſaid ſhe) is there no more hope of your diſcretion? No more (ſaid I) then of ſincerity in your amity. She ſtaid ſome while ſilent, looking on me, and drawing neere me, ſaid, At leaſt promiſe me, that you will not looke on it, till I haue diſcourſed to you all that is paſt. I am content (ſayd I) prouided that you proue not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:177519:35"/>
a lyer. After ſhe had ſworne to me, ſhe would tell me all truely, and I ſworne, not to make ſhew of it, ſhe recounted vnto me all that I haue ſayd of <hi>Ligdamon:</hi> and at this preſent (going forward) he comes to ſend me this letter, and I haue enough of his complaints, or rather, of his fay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings. But (anſwered I) what if they be true? And if they be (ſayd ſhe) what haue I to doe with his follies? For that reaſon (ſayd I) that they are bound to helpe the miſerable, that haue throwne him downe head-long. And what can I do to his euill (replyed ſhe?) Can I doe leſſe then liue, ſince I am in the world? Wherefore hath he his eyes? Why comes he where I am? All theſe excuſes (ſayd I) are nothing worth: for you are (without doubt) acceſſary to his euill. If you were of leſſe perfection, if you could make your ſelfe leſſe louely, thinke you he would be brought to this extremity? And truly (ſaid ſhe, ſmiling to me) You are very pleaſant, to charge me with this fault. What would you haue me to be, if I ſhould not be the ſame that I am? And why, <hi>Siluie</hi> (anſwered I?) Know you not that he that puts a weapon in the hands of a mad man, is in part culpable of the harme he doth? And why ſhould not you be ſo, ſince this beauty, which the heauens, at your birth, haue giuen you, hath beene by you ſo curiouſly ſharpned with ſo many vertues and amiable perfections, which no eye (without being ſtrucken) can looke on? And ſhall not you be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for the murders which your cruelty commits? Behold your ſelfe <hi>(Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie)</hi> there is no neceſſity that you ſhould be leſſe faire, nor leſſe repleniſhed with perfections, but you are to ſtudy the more to make your ſelfe good, as you are faire, and to put as much ſweetneſſe into your ſoule, as the heauens haue in your face. But the miſchiefe is, your eyes, to do the more hurt, haue taken all away, and haue left nothing at all but rigour and cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Now gentle ſhepheard, that which makes me ſo affectionate to the defence of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> was, that beſides that we are ſome what allied, hee was alſo well eſteemed of all that knew him, and I knew he was brought to very hard tearmes. Then after ſuch like talke, I opened the letter, and read it aloud that ſhe might vnderſtand it: but ſhe caſt not ſo much as her eye to it, which I found very ſtrange, and well foreſaw, that if I vſed not wondrous great force, I ſhould hardly draw from her any good remedy for my ſicke patient: which vrged me to tell her, at the firſt blow, that in any caſe I would not ſuffer <hi>Ligdamon</hi> to vndoe himſelfe. Good ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, ſince you are ſo pittifull, heale him your ſelfe. It is not of me, ſaid I, that his healing depends; but I aſſure you, that if you hold in this ſort to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, as you haue done for the time paſſed, I will cauſe you to haue
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:177519:36"/>
ſome diſpleaſure: for I will make <hi>Amaſis</hi> vnderſtand of it, and there ſhall be no one of our companions, to whom I will not tell it. So you ſhall play the foole well enough, replyed ſhe. Doubt not, anſwered I: for to make ſhort, I loue <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and I will not ſee him loſt, ſo farre as I can helpe it. You ſpeake very wiſely, <hi>Leonide,</hi> (ſaid ſhe in choler:) theſe are the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that I alwaies expected from your amity. My amity, anſwered I, ſhould be the ſame for you againſt him, if he had done the wrong. At this we ſtaied ſome good while without ſpeaking. In the end, I asked her what her reſolution was. Such as you will, ſaid ſhe, prouided, you do me not the diſpleaſure, to publiſh the follies of <hi>Ligdamon;</hi> for, though I cannot bee blamed, yet it would trouble me to haue it publiſhed. See (cried I out the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) what humour is this of yours, <hi>Siluie?</hi> You feare it ſhould be knowne that a man loues you, &amp; you fear not to haue it known that you haue cauſed his death. Becauſe (ſaid ſhe) they may ſuſpect the former to be produced by ſome conſent on my part, but not the latter. Let vs leaue this, replied I, and reſolue your ſelfe, I will that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> for the time to come, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained in another ſort. And then I went on, that ſhee ſhould aſſure her ſelfe that I would not ſuffer him to die, and that I would haue her write to him in ſuch a faſhion, that he might no more deſpaire, that when hee were recouered, I was contented ſhe ſhould vſe him as ſhe liſt, prouided, that ſhe let him liue. I had paine enough to obtaine this grace from her, though I threatned to make it knowne: ſo, after long debate, and hauing made her beginne againe, once, twice or thrice, in the end ſhee wrote in this ſort:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>IF there be any thing in you that pleaſes mee, your death is the leaſt of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the acknowledgement of your fault hath ſatisfied me, and I will haue no other reuenge of your boldneſſe, then the paine which you ſhall haue. Know your ſelfe hereafter, and you ſhall know me. Farewell, and liue.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>I wrote theſe words at the end of the letter, to the end he might hope for better, hauing ſo good a ſecond.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>LEonide <hi>hath put the pen into this Nymphs hand. Loue wils it; your iuſtice requires it; her indeuour commands it: but her obſtinate conceit hath great defence: ſince this fauour is the firſt I could procure you, cheriſh your ſelfe and hope.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Theſe letters were brought him ſo luckily, that yet hauing ſtrength
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:177519:36"/>
enough to reade them, he ſaw the commandement that <hi>Silue</hi> had giuen him to liue: and becauſe till then, he would neuer vſe any remedy, that he might not diſobey the Nymph, he gouerned himſelfe ſo, that in ſhort time he was better, were it for that his diſeaſe hauing ſpent its force, was declining, or that the contentment of the ſoule was a good remedy for the paines of the body: ſo it was, that after that, his diſeaſe dayly leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened. But this ſo little mooued this cruell beauty, that ſhe changed not one whit towards him, and when he was well, the moſt fauourable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere he could haue, was; I loue you not, neither doe I hate you, reſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, that of all thoſe which ſeeke me, you are he that diſpleaſes mee leaſt. If he or I requeſted ſome better declaration, ſhe vſes ſuch cruell words to vs, that no other but her courage could imagine, nor other af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection beare them, then that of <hi>Ligdamon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not to draw this diſcourſe in length, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> loues, and ſerued alwaies after, without any likelihood of hope, but that which I haue told you, vntill the time that <hi>Clidaman</hi> was choſen by fortune to ſerue her, then he had almoſt loſt reſolution; and had it not beene, that he knew by me, that he ſhould be no better vſed, I know not what would haue become of him. Yet though this gaue him ſome comfort, the greatneſſe of his Riuall gaue him more of iealouſie. I remember once he gaue me this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, vpon that which I told him, that he ſhould not grieue ſo much for <hi>Clidaman:</hi> Faire Nymph (anſwered he) I will freely tell you whence my care proceeds, and then iudge if I haue wrong. It is long time ſince I haue prooued, that <hi>Siluie</hi> cannot be mooued, neither by fidelity of affection, nor by extremity of Loue, that it is without doubt that ſhe will neuer bee wounded on that ſide. Notwithſtanding, as I haue learned of the wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> your vnckle, euery perſon is ſubiect to one certaine force, the ſtroke whereof they cannot auoyd, when ought it is touched. And what may I think, may be that of this faire, if it be not the greatneſſe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and, as I feare, the fortune &amp; not the merits of <hi>Clidaman;</hi> his greatnes, and not his affection? But indeed, herein he hath wrong: for neither the loue of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> nor the greatneſſe of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> can euer mooue one glance of good will in <hi>Siluie.</hi> And beleeue not but loue reſerues her for an example to others, purpoſing to puniſh her by ſome vnuſuall meanes, Now at that time there fel out a great teſtimony of her beauty, or at leaſt of the force ſhe hath to make her beloued.</p>
                  <p>It was the day ſo celebrated, which euery yeere we make holy, the ſixt of the Moone of <hi>Iuly,</hi> and on which <hi>Amaſis</hi> vſed to make that ſolemne ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as well for the honour of the Feaſt, as for being the day of <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thees</hi>

brith. When they were at Sacrifice, there came into the Temple, a number of men, clad in mourning, in the middeſt of whom was a Knighr, ſo full of Maieſty aboue the reſt, that he was eaſily iudged to be their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. He was ſo ſad and melancholy, that it appeared that he had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what in his ſoule that troubled him. His habite blacke, infaſhion of a mantle, trayning on the ground, which kept the beauty of his proportion from ſight, but his face vncouered, and his head bare, the haire where of yellow and criſped, ſhamed the Sun, &amp; drew the eyes of all men to him. He came with a ſtately pace to the place where <hi>Amaſis</hi> was, and after he had kiſſed her robe, he withdrew, waiting till the ſacrifices were done, and by fortune, whether good or bad for him, I know not, he ſtood right ouer-a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Siluie.</hi> A ſtrange effect of loue! He had no ſooner ſet his eyes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, but he knew her, though he neuer ſaw her before; and to be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſſured, he demanded of one of his followers, who knew vs all: his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was accompanted with a deepe ſigh from the ſtranger: and all the while the ſacrifice laſted, his eye neuer went off her. At laſt, the ſacrifice being ended, <hi>Amaſis</hi> returnes to her Palace, where audience being giuen him, he ſpake before them all in this ſort:</p>
                  <p>Madam, though the mourning you ſee in my garments, be much more blacke in my ſoule, yet can it not equall the cauſe I haue. And though my loſſe be excreme, yet thinke I not I am the onely man that haue loſt; for you are particularly weakned in your faithfull ſeruants, of one, which (it may be) was not the leaſt affectioned, nor the moſt vnprofitable in your ſeruice. This conſideration hath made me hope to obtaine of you ſome reuenge of his death againſt his murderer. But ſince I entred into this Temple, I haue loſt all hope; iudging, that if the deſire of reuenge die in me, that am the brother of the wronged, by much ſtronger reaſou ſhould it ſhrinke in you, Madame, in whom the compaſſion of the dead, and the ſeruice which he vowed you, may without more adoe, cauſe ſome good will to ariſe. Notwithſtanding, ſince I ſee the armes of my brothers mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, prepared already againſt me; not to auoyd ſuch a death, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct others, I will tell you as briefly as I can, the fortune of him whom I lament. Though, Madame, I haue not the honor to be knowne to you, yet, I aſſure my ſelf, that at the naming of my brother, who neuer loued but your ſeruice, you will acknowledge me for your moſt humble ſeruant.

When I came firſt to him, it was about the time, that great and wiſe <hi>Aetius</hi> treated of a peace with <hi>Meroue</hi> and the <hi>Franks</hi> (for ſo he called all that follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him) to reſiſt that ſcourge of God; <hi>Attilla,</hi> king of the <hi>Huns,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gathered together, from the Deſarts of <hi>Aſia,</hi> an incredible num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people, euen to 500000. fighting men, diſcended like a deluge, ſacking furiouſly all the countrys, where he paſſed; and though this <hi>Aeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> Lieutenant generall in <hi>Gaule of Valentinian,</hi> was come with a purpoſe to make war on <hi>Meroue,</hi> who during the gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of <hi>Caſtinus</hi> was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of a part of <hi>Gaule,</hi> yet thought he it better to make him his friend, and the <hi>Viſigots &amp; Burgonians</hi> like wiſe, rather then to be ouerthrowne by <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilla,</hi> who lately hauing trauerſed in <hi>Germany,</hi> was about the ba<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ks of <hi>Rine,</hi> where he ſtayd not long without aduancing himſelfe ſo into <hi>Gaule,</hi> that he beſieged the towne of <hi>Orleance,</hi> where the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of <hi>Thierry,</hi> king of the <hi>Viſigots,</hi> made him raiſe his ſiege, &amp; take another way: but beſet by <hi>Meroue</hi> &amp; <hi>Aetius,</hi> with their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>federates in the field of <hi>Cathalona,</hi> he was defeated more by the valiance of the <hi>Franks,</hi> &amp; the wiſedom of <hi>Meroue,</hi> then all the other force.

Maſter, beloued of my companions, cheriſhed and honored generally of all, for a certaine good opinion they conceiue of me, for affaires that fell out, which (it may be) got me with them, more authority &amp; credit, then my age and capacity might merit. I could not, knowing the ſickneſſe of my brother, ſtay longer time with <hi>Childerick,</hi> but taking leaue of him, &amp; promiſing him to returne very ſhortly, I came backe with the haſte that my loue required.

                  <p>It would ſerue but to trouble you, and wound my ſelfe afreſh, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count vnto you the things, which our amity wrought betweene vs. So it was, that either 2. or 3. daies, after my brother was brought to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, that he could hardly draw his breath, and yet that cruell loue inclined him more to ſighing, then to the neceſſity hee had of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in all his raging fits, we could heare nothing, but the name of <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie:</hi> I, to whom the diſpleaſure of his death was ſo violent, that I could hardly diſſemble, wiſhed ſo much euill to this vnknowne <hi>Siluie,</hi> that I could not hold from cnrſing her; which when my brother heard, and his affection as yet greater then his diſeaſe, hee enforced himſelfe to ſpeake this: Brother, if you will not bee my greateſt enemy, for beare, I beſeech you, theſe imprecations, which cannot but diſpleaſe mee much more then my diſeaſe. I had much rather not bee at all, then that they ſhould take effect, and being vnprofitable, what will it auaile you, vnleſſe it be to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to me, how much you hate that which I loue? I know well, my loſſe will trouble you, and therein I haue more feeling of our ſeparation, then of my end. But ſince euery man is borne to dye, why with me do you not thanke the heauens, which haue choſen me the faireſt death, and the moſt faire murderer that euer man had? The extremity of my affection, and the extremity of the vertue of <hi>Siluie,</hi> are the armes by which her beauty is ſerued, to put me into my griefe; and why do you bewaile me, &amp; wiſh euill to her, to whom I wiſh more good then to my ſoule? I thinke hee would haue ſaid more, but his ſtrength failed, and I more wet with teares of pitty, then when againſt <hi>Attila</hi> I was all on a ſweat vnder my armor, and my armes ſprinkled with bloud, all ouer me. Brother, ſhe that takes you from yours, is the moſt vniuſt that euer was: and if ſhe be faire, the gods haue done the iniuſtice in her; for either they ſhould haue changed her face or her heart. Then <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> hauing gotten a little more ſtrength, replied to me, For Gods ſake, <hi>Guymantes,</hi> blaſpheme no more in
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177519:38"/>
this ſort, &amp; beleeue that <hi>Siluie</hi> hath an heart anſwerable to her face, that as the one is full of beauty, ſo the other is of vertue; that if for louing her I die, doe not you wonder, becauſe that if the eye cannot, without daze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, abide the beames of one Sun without cloudy, how may not my ſoule remaine dazeled at the beames of ſo many Suns, which gliſter in this faire? that if I haue ſcarce taſted ſuch diuinities, without death, I may haue the contentment of him, that dies to ſee <hi>Iupiter</hi> in his diuinity? I would tell you, that as her death giues witneſſe, that no other had euer ſeene ſo much of diuinity as ſhee; ſo, that no man euer loued ſo much of beauty, nor ſo much of vertue, as I. Now I that came from an exerciſe, that made mee beleeue there was no loue forced, but voluntary, with which men go on flattering themſelues in idleneſſe, ſaid to him, Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that one ſole beauty ſhould be the cauſe of your death? My bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (anſwered he) I am in ſuch extremity, that I thinke I cannot anſwere your demands: but (ſaid he on, taking me by the hand) for brotherly loue, and for our particular, which binds vs yet faſter, I adiure you to promiſe me one gift. I did ſo. Then he ſaid on, Beare as from me, this kiſſe to <hi>Siluy:</hi> and then he kiſſed my hand: and obſerue that which you finde of my laſt will; and when you ſee this Nympho, you ſhall know that which you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me. At this word, with a blaſt his ſoule flew vp, &amp; his body lay cold in my armes.</p>
                  <p>The affliction that I felt in this loſſe, as it cannot be imagined but by him that hath beene in it, ſo it cannot be conceiued, but by the heart that ſuffered it, and hardly can the word reach that, which the thought may not attaine: ſo that without longer abode in bewailing this diſaſter, I wil ſay, Madam, that as ſoone as my dolours would ſuffer me, I haue ſet my ſelfe on the way, as well to render you the homage which I owe you, and to demand iuſtice of you for the death of <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> as to fulfill my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which I made him againſt his homicide, and to preſent that which by his laſt will he left in writing, to the end that I may call my ſelfe as iuſt an obſeruer of my word, as his affection hath beene inuiolable. But at the inſtant when I was preſented before you, and that I meant to open my mouth againſt this murderer, I haue found my brothers words ſo true, that not only I excuſe his death, but deſire and require the like. This ſhall bee then, Madam, with your permiſſion, which I will performe: and then making a great reuerence to <hi>Amaſis,</hi> he choſe from among vs <hi>Siluie,</hi> and reſting one knee on the ground, he ſaid, Faire murtherer, though on this faire breſt there fall but one teare of pitty, at the newes of the death of the perſon which was ſo much yours, you ceaſe not to haue entire &amp; ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:177519:39"/>
victory; yet, if you iudge that to ſo many flames which you haue lighted in him, ſo ſmall a drop ſhall not bee a great aſſwagement, receiue at leaſt the burning kiſſe which hee bequeaths you, when preſently his ſoule turned into this kiſſe, which he ſet in this faire hand, rich indeed with the ſpoiles of many other mens liberties, but in none more fully then that of his. At this word, hee kiſſed her hand, and then held on thus af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was riſen:</p>
                  <p>Among the papers where <hi>Ariſtander</hi> put his laſt Will, we haue found this heere; and becauſe it is encloſed in the faſhion you ſee, and that he directed it to you, I bring it you, with the proteſtation which by his teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he commaunded me to make before you open it; that if your will be not to grant the requeſt he hath made you, he beſeecheth you not to reade it at all, to the end, that as well in death, as in life, he may not feele the ſtrokes of your cruelty. Then he preſented her a letter, which <hi>Siluie,</hi> troubled with this accident, would haue refuſed, but for <hi>Amaſis</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: And after, <hi>Guymantes</hi> beganne his ſpeech againe thus: I haue hitherto performed the laſt Will of <hi>Aristander:</hi> there remaines, that I ſhould purſue vpon his homicide his cruell death; but if at another time the offence haue giuen mee the commaund, at this time Loue or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daines, that my moſt faire vengeance be the ſacrifice of my liberty, on the ſame Altar that yet ſmokes with that of my brother, who being raui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed from me, when I breathed nothing againſt you, but bloud and death, giues witneſſe, that euery eye that ſees you, owes you his heart for tribute, &amp; that vniuſtly euery man liues, that liues not in your ſeruice. <hi>Siluie</hi> ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what confounded with this accident, ſtayed ſome long while from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; ſo that <hi>Amaſis</hi> tooke the paper which ſhe had in her hand, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſayd to <hi>Guymantes,</hi> that <hi>Siluie</hi> ſhould make anſwer, ſhe withdrew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide with ſome of vs, and breaking the boxe, read theſe words:</p>
                  <p>If my affection haue not made my ſeruice pleaſing, nor my ſeruice mine affection, at the leaſt, eyther this affection ſhall make my death in you more pittifull, or my death aſſure you of the fidelitie of my affection; and that as no man euer loued more of perfections, ſo did neuer any loue with more paſſion. The laſt teſtimony which I will giue you, ſhal be the gift by him whom I hold moſt deare next you, who is my brother; for I know well, what I giue you, when I ordaine, that he ſhould ſee you, kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing well by experience, that it is impoſſible he ſhould be, and not loue you. Deſire not (my ſayre murderer) that he ſhould be inheritor of my fortune, but heare of this, that I haue leſſe iuſtly merited of all others then of you. He that writ it, is a ſeruant, who for hauing leſſe of loue then one

heart was capable to conceiue, would rather die then diminiſh.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Amaſis</hi> then calling <hi>Siluie,</hi> demaunded what ſo great cruelty ſhe had vſed againſt <hi>Ariſtander,</hi> which brought him vnto that extremity. The Nymph bluſhing, anſwered, that ſhe knew not whereof he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine. I would (ſayd ſhe) that you receiue <hi>Guymantes</hi> into his place: then calling him before them all, ſhe asked if he would obſerue his brothers will? He anſwered, Yes, ſo it be not a thing contrary to his affection. He requireth this Nymph (ſayd <hi>Amaſis)</hi> to receiue you into his place, and that you haue better fortune then he. To receiue you, I command her; for the fortune whereof he ſpeakes, it is neyther the prayer, nor the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement of another that can frame that, but the proper merit, or the fortune it ſelfe. <hi>Guymantes,</hi> after he had kiſſed the robe of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> came to doe as much to the hands of <hi>Siluie,</hi> in ſigne of ſeruitude: but ſhe was ſo diſpleaſed with him for the reproches which he had giuen her, and with the declaration of his affection, that without the commandement of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> ſhe would not haue permited him.</p>

Words which he ſpake with affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vehemency, becauſe that out of good iudgement he had loued <hi>Siluie.</hi> But <hi>Guymantes,</hi> who, beſides his new loue, had ſo good an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelfe, that he would giue no place to any perſon in the world, anſwered, addreſſing his ſpeech to <hi>Amaſis:</hi> Madam, there be that would not I ſhould be ſeruant to the faire <hi>Siluie:</hi> they that ſpeake it, know little of loue, otherwiſe they would not thinke, that your ordinances, nor of all the gods together, were of ſorce ſufficient to diuert the courſe of our affection: therefore it is that I declare couertly, that if they deny me that which heeretofore hath beene allowed me, I ſhall diſobey and turne rebel, &amp; that no conſideration ought to change me. And then turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Clidaman,</hi> I know the reſpect I owe you (ſaid he) but I feel withal, the power that Loue hath ouer me. If the Deſtinies haue giuen you to <hi>Siluie,</hi> her beauty is it that hath gott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

ordinances, but they haue not infringed them. You were commaunded ſerue <hi>Siluie,</hi> but they denyed to others. Sweet oyntments giue the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſmell when they are chaſed. A louer likewiſe hauing a Riuall, giueth more proofe of his merits. So <hi>Amaſis</hi> ordayned, and now behold <hi>Siluie</hi> well ſerued. For <hi>Guymantes</hi> forgot not any thing that his Loue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded: and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> out of enuy, ſtudied to appeare more carefull.</p>
                  <p>But aboue all, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> ſerued her with ſuch diſcretion and reſpect, that oftentimes he durſt not come neere her, left he ſhould giue notice of his affection to others. And in my minde, his ſeruice was as pleaſing as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the reſt. But indeed one time he almoſt loſt his patience. It happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that <hi>Amaſis</hi> hand lighted on a bodkin made in the ſhape of a ſword, wherewith <hi>Siluie</hi> was wont to raiſe and dreſſe her haire, and ſeeing <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi> neere her, ſhe gaue it him to beare to his miſtris, but he kept it all the day, to put <hi>Guymantes</hi> to ſome payne.

nor draw other thing from him, but that <hi>Siluie</hi> had giuen him a blow with a Sword: and leauing me, he went away the moſt loſt man on the earth. See how artificiall a ſencer is Loue, that with ſo ſmall weapons can make ſo great gaſhes! It grieued me to ſee him in this caſe. And to know if any new accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t had befallen him, I went to <hi>Siluie;</hi> but ſhe ſwore ſhe knew not what it might be. In the end, hauing ſtayed ſome time to reade the verſes; on a ſuddaine ſhe lifted vp her hand to her haire, and not finding her bodkin, ſhe began to laugh, and ſayd, That her bodkin had beene loſt, and ſome body had found it, and without doubt (it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I deſired her to let him keepe it no longer. I ſee (ſayd ſhe) his diſcretion, hereafter I will vſe the power I haue ouer him. She fayled not of her purpoſe: for being neere him, ſhe ſayd; See a Sword that is mine. He anſwered, So is he that beares it. I would haue it, ſayd ſhe. I would, anſwered he, you would all of me that is yours. Will you not giue it me (ſaid the Nymph?) How (replyed he?) can I will any thing, ſince I haue no will at all? And (ſayd ſhe) what haue you done with that which you had? You haue ſnat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched it from me (ſayd he) and now it is changed into yours. Since then (continued ſhe) that your will is but mine, giue me that bodkin, becauſe my will is ſo. Since (ſayd he) that I will that thing that you would, and that you will haue this bodkin, it muſt of neceſſity be, that I will haue it alſo. <hi>Siluie</hi> ſmiled a little, but in the end ſhe ſayd: I will that you giue it me. And I alſo (ſaid he) will, that you giue it me. Then the Nymph thruſt forth her hand, and took it. I wil neuer refuſe it (ſayd he) though you will take it from me, and it were this heart for once. <hi>Siluie</hi> had her Sword, and I writ this ſcroule to <hi>Ligdamon:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>THe good which without knowledge hath beene done to your Riuall, with his knowledge is taken from him: iudge in what termes his affayres are, ſince the fauours he hath, proceeded of ignorance, but the disfauours, of deliberation.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>So <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was healed, not by the ſame hand, but by the ſame wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that hurt him. In the meane time, the affection of <hi>Guymantes</hi> came to ſuch an extremity, that (it may be) it came nothing ſhort of that of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtander;</hi> on the other ſide <hi>Clidaman,</hi> vnder the cloke of courteſie had let grow, in his ſoule, a moſt ardent and true loue. After they had many times aſſayed, out of enuy, who ſhould be the moſt welcome to <hi>Siluie,</hi> and knew that ſhe fauoured and diſ-fauoured them both alike, they reſolued
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:177519:41"/>
one day, becauſe that otherwiſe there was mutuall loue betweene them, to know which of the two was moſt beloued, and came for that cauſe to <hi>Siluie,</hi> from whom they had ſuch 'cold anſwers, that they could not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoile the iudgement. Then, by the counſell of a Druyde, who (it may be) was diſpleaſed to ſee two ſuch perſons loſe their time ſo vnprofitably, which they might much better employ for the defence of the <hi>Gaules,</hi> whom ſo many Barbarians attempted to ouer-run, they came to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the verity of Loue. You know what the property of this water is, and how it declareth, againſt their will, the moſt ſecret thoughts of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers; for he that lookes in it, ſees his Miſtris; and if he be loued, he ſees himſelfe hard by; and if ſhe loue any other, that is his figure that hee ſees. Now <hi>Clidaman</hi> was the firſt that preſented himſelfe, he layd his knee to the ground, kiſſed the ſide of the fountaine: And hauing beſought the <hi>Demon</hi> of that place, to be more fauourable to him then to <hi>Damon,</hi> he bent himſelfe ſomewhat into it. Preſently <hi>Siluie</hi> preſented her ſelfe ſo faire and admirable, that the louer tranſported ſtooped to kiſſe her hand: bat this contentment was well changed when he ſawe no body neere her. He wichdrew himſelfe, much troubled, after he had ſtayed ſome while; And vnwilling to ſpeake any thing, he made ſigne to <hi>Guymantes,</hi> that he ſhould prooue his fortune. He with all the ceremonies requiſite, hauing made his requeſt, caſt his eye on the fountayne, but was ſerued like <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Siluie</hi> alone preſented her ſelfe, burning (almoſt) with her fayre eyes, the water which ſeemed to play about her. They were both aſtoniſhed at this accident, and demaunded the cauſe of this Druyde, which was a great Magician. He anſwered, that it was, for that <hi>Siluie</hi> as yet loued no perſon, as being not capable to be burnt, but onely to burne. They that thought they could not be ſo much neglected, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing gone before ſeuerally, now returned both together, and ſodaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both the one and the other ſhifted on diuers ſides; yet the Nymph appeared alone. The Druyde ſmiling came to withdraw them from thence, and tolde them, that they ſhould beleeue they were not beloued at all, and that the ſhifting from ſide to ſide, could not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their figure in the water. For you muſt know (ſayd he) that as other waters repreſent the bodies, which are before them, this repreſents the ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſpirit, which is but the will, the memory and the iudgement, when it is beloued, transformeth it ſelfe into the thing beloued; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that when you preſented your ſelues heere, it receiued the figure of your ſpirits, and not of your body; and your ſpirit being changed into
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:177519:41"/>
                     <hi>Siluie,</hi> it repreſented <hi>Siluie,</hi> and not you. Whereas, if <hi>Siluie</hi> had loued you, ſhe ſhould as well haue beene changed into you, as you into her: and ſo repreſenting your ſpirit, you ſawe <hi>Siluie;</hi> and ſeeing <hi>Siluie</hi> changed, as I told you by this loue, you ſhould haue ſeene your ſelues alſo. <hi>Clidaman</hi> ſtood very attentiue to this diſcourſe; and conſidering the concluſion was an aſſurance of that he feared, being full of choller, drawing out his Sword, he ſtrucke two or three blowes with all his might on the marble of the fountaine: but his Sword being at the firſt reſiſted, in the end, it brake in the middle, not leauing any marke of his blowes; imitating heerein the angry dogge, that biteth the ſtone one flings at him. The Druyde gaue him to vnderſtand, that he trauailed in vaine, becauſe that his enchantment could not be ended by force, but by extremity of loue: yet if he liſted to make it vnprofitable, he knew the meane. <hi>Clidaman</hi> nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed for rarity within great Cages of yron, two Lions, and two Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes, which he oftentimes cauſed to fight with other beaſts.</p>
                  <p>Now this Druyde demaunded them to keepe this fountaine, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanted them in ſuch ſort, that although they were ſet at liberty, yet could they not leaue the entry of that Caue, but onely when they were to ſeeke their foode. For in that while there ſtayed but two, and euer ſince they haue done no hurt to any, but thoſe which attempted to go to the fountayne; but they aſſayled them with ſuch fury, that there is no likelihoode that any will hazard himſelfe. For the Lions are ſo large and terrible; they haue their clawes ſo long and ſo piercing; ſo nimble and ſwift, and ſo animated to this defence, that they doe deedes incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible. On the other ſide, the Vnicornes haue their hornes ſo poynted, and ſo ſtrong, that they will pier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e a very rocke: they ſtrike with ſuch force and ſwiftneſſe, that no man can auoide them. As ſoone as this guard was thus ordered, <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Guymantes</hi> departed away ſo ſecretly, that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis</hi> nor <hi>Siluie</hi> knew nothing, vntill they were farre off. They went to ſeeke out <hi>Meroue</hi> and <hi>Childericke.</hi> For they haue told vs ſince, that ſince they were ſo equally handled by their loue, they would try if Armes would fauour them as equally.</p>
                  <p>Thus (gentle ſhepheard) haue we loſt the commodity of this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, which ſo well diſcouered the ſecrets of deceiuing thoughts, that if all were as <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> they would not haue made vs loſe it: For, when I knew that <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Guymantes</hi> were gone, I counſelled him to bee the third, aſſuring my ſelfe he ſhould be the more fauoured; but he made me this anſwer: Faire <hi>Leonide,</hi> I alwaies counſell them that are in doubt of their good or euill, that they hazard themſelues ſometimes, to know
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:177519:42"/>
the truth. But would not this be folly for him, that hauing neuer concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any hope of that he deſires, to ſeeke for a more ſure knowledge of his diſaſter? As for me, I am not in doubt, whether the faire <hi>Siluie</hi> loue me, or not; I am but too aſſured of it, and when I would know more, I neede not aske but of her eyes and her actions. Since that time his affection hath ſtill increaſed, like the fire, when they lay on more wood: For this is the property of that faculty, to make that which pleaſes, more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that which offends, moſt offenſiue: and God knowes how this cruell hath handled him. The time is yet to come, that ſhe would looke on him without diſdaine or cruelty: and for my part, I know not how a generous man can haue ſuch patience, becauſe indeed, the offences which ſhe hath done him, touch more of outrage then of rigor. One day, when he met her going out to walke alone with me, becauſe he had a ſweete voyce, I prayed him to ſing: he ſaid theſe verſes:</p>

                  <p>He had no ſooner ended, but <hi>Siluie</hi> takes him vp thus: Ha! tell me, <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damon,</hi> ſince I am not the cauſe of your euill, why doe you lay it on mee? It is your owne deſire which you ſhould accuſe; for it is it that makes you trauaile in vaine. The paſſionate <hi>Ligdamon</hi> anſwered, Deſire, indeed, is chat which torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts me: but it is not that which ſhuld be blamed, but that which giues it birth, and that is the vertues and perfections of <hi>Siluie.</hi> If the deſires, replied ſhe, be not irregular, they torment not: and if they be irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, and goe beyond reaſon, they ought to be borne of another obiect then of vertue, and are not the true children of ſuch a father, ſince they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him nothing. Till this time, anſwered <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> I neuer heard ſay, that any diſauowed a child, for not reſembling his father; and yet the extreme deſires are not againſt reaſon: for, is it not reaſonable to deſire all good things, according to the degree of their goodneſſe? and ſo an extreme beauty ſhould bee reaſonably loued in extremity: ſo that if they muſt be blamed in any thing, a man ſhould not ſay, they are againſt reaſon, but beyond reaſon. Let this ſuffice, replyed this cruell, I am not more reaſonable then reaſon: therefore it is, that I will not auow for mine, that which exceedes. At this word, not to leaue him the meane to anſwer, ſhee turned to meete ſome of her companions that followed her.</p>
                  <p>One time, when <hi>Amaſis</hi> returned from that little place of <hi>Mont-briſon,</hi> where the pleaſure of the garden, and ſolitarineſſe, had ſtayed her longer then ſhe meant, the night came on her before ſhe came to <hi>Marſellis.</hi> And becauſe the euening was cold, as we went, I asked him on the way, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to make him ſpeake before his miſtriſſe, if he felt not the cold and humidity of the euening? Whereto he anſwered, that of long time the cold nor heate outward had done him hurt. And asking him, why, and what his receit was? To the one, he anſwered me, I oppoſe my burning deſires; and to the other, my frozen hopes. If it be ſo (ſayd I ſuddainly) whence came it, that I haue ſo often heard you ſay you burne, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, that you freeze. Ah! (anſwered he) with a great ſigh: Courteous Nymph, the euill whereof I complaine, torments me not outwardly, but inwardly; and yet ſo deepely, that there is no ſecret part of my ſoule ſo retired, where I feele not the griefe. For you muſt know, that aboue all
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:177519:43"/>
other, that the fire and colde are incompatibles alike. But I haue had within my heart continually the fire on a flame, and the colde frozen, and onely feele the diſcommodity without any mitigation. <hi>Siluie</hi> could hold no longer from making him feele her accuſtomed cruelties, but till that word was ended. Yet me thoght, ſhe wold ſcarce giue him the leiſure to bring forth, that ſo full of enuy ſhe was, to make him feele her ſtings, when turning toward me with a ſmile, ſhe ſayd diſdainefully, caſting her head on his ſide. Oh! how happy is <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> to haue both cold and heat when he will? at leaſt, he hath no cauſe to complaine, nor to feele many diſcommodities: for, if the cold of his hope freeze, he may chafe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe with the heate of his deſires; if his ouer-ardent deſires doe burne him, he may coole himſelfe with the ice of his hopes. It is very neceſſary (fayre <hi>Siluie,</hi> anſwered <hi>Ligdamon)</hi> that I ſhould vſe this remedy to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne me, otherwiſe I had not beene long ſince; but this is but a ſmall aſſwaging of ſo great a fire: ſo that the knowledge of theſe things is a freſh wound which offends me the more, for that in the greatneſſe of my deſires I know their weakeneſſe, and in their weakeneſſe their greatneſſe. You figure your euill (replyed the Nymph) ſuch as you pleaſe: but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue not, that the cold being ſo neere the heate, and the heate ſo neere the cold, neyther the one, nor the other will ſuffer his neighbour to be much offended.</p>
                  <p>Indeede (anſwered <hi>Ligdamon)</hi> to make me burne and freeze at one time, is not one of the leaſt maruels that proceed from you; but this is the greateſt, that it is of your cold, that my heate commeth, and of my heate, your ice. But yet it is more maruellous, to ſee a man haue ſuch ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, added the Nymph: for they conceiue ſuch impoſſible things, that he that beleeues them, may aſwell be taxed for want of iudgement, as you that tell them, for want of truth. I confeſſe, anſwered he, that my imaginations conceiue things impoſſible; but that proceeds from my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-great affection, and from your ouer-great cruelty: and as this is one of your leaſt effects, that you reproch me with, ſo it is not one of my leaſt tonments. I beleeue, ſayd ſhe, that your torments, and mine effects, are of greateſt force in your diſcourſe. Hardly, ſayd <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> can a man ſay that which he doth not well vnderſtand. Hardly (replied the Nymph) may the conceits and vaine Ideaes of a diſtempered imagination come to be knowne. If the truth, adioyned <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> accompany not this imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhould hardly ſtand in ſo great need of your compaſſion. Men (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Nymph) make their trophees of our bounty. Do you any whit better, ſaid he, out of our loſſe? I neuer ſawe (replied <hi>Siluie)</hi> any ſo vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:177519:43"/>
but they ſhifted wellenough, as you do all.</p>

And indeed, <hi>Leonide</hi> deceiued her not; for though ſhe were deſirous, <hi>Lindamor</hi> might me ſatiſfied; yet ſhe that loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for all her aduancement from <hi>Galathee,</hi> had no greater deſire then to content her: but loue, which ordinarily makes paſtime with the wiſdome of louers, and delights to conduct his effects contrary to their purpoſes, made <hi>Leonide,</hi> by conuerſing with the ſhepheard, to ſtand in more need of one to ſpeake for her, then any other in the company. For the ordinary view of this ſhepherd, who wanted nothing that might winne loue, made her know, that beauty hath ouer-ſecret intelligences with our ſoule, to ſuffer it ſo freely to come neere his powers, without ſuſpition of treaſon. The ſhepheard ſoone perceiued it, but the affection which hee bare to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> which yet exceedingly raged, would not ſuffer him to indure this growing loue, with patience. That was the cauſe that hee reſolued to take his leaue of <hi>Galathee,</hi> when he began to find himſelfe ſomewhat bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But as ſoone as hee opened his mouth about it, How is it, ſaid ſhee, <hi>Celadon,</hi> are you hardly vſed by me, that you will be gone before you be throughly recouerd? And when he anſwerd, it was for feare of troubling her; and for ſome buſines he was conſtrained to returne to his Hamlet, to aſſure his parents &amp; his friends of his health: ſhe interrupted him, ſaying, No, <hi>Celadon,</hi> doubt not my trouble, ſo I ſee you want nothing: and as for
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:177519:45"/>
your affaires, and friends, without me, whoſe company (it ſeems) miſlikes you much, you ſhall not be in this paine, ſince you will no longer. And me thinks the greateſt buſineſſe that you haue to do, is to ſatiſfie the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which you haue to me, &amp; that your ingratitude ſhould not be ſmal, if you grudge mee ſome moments of your life, which you hold all of mee. Henceforth you muſt not fet your eies on things ſo baſe, as your life paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but you are to leaue your hamlets, and your flocks to them that haue not the merits that you haue; and for the time to come, you muſt place your eyes on me that can, and will do for you, if your actions alter not my minde. Though the ſhepheard ſeemed not to vnderſtand this diſcourſe, yet hee conceiued it eaſily enough, and from that time auoided, what hee could poſſibly, to talke with her in priuate. But the diſpleaſure which this life brought him, was ſuch, that almoſt loſing all patience, one day <hi>Leonide</hi> hearing him ſigh, demanded the cauſe, ſeeing hee was in place where they deſired nothing more then his contentment. He anſwerd her (faire Nymph) among all miſerable men, I may hold my ſelfe to bee the moſt extremely handled by fortune; for commonly they that be in griefe, haue permiſſion to complaine, and haue the comfort to be moned: but I dare not, for that my miſfortune comes couered with the moſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and therefore in ſtead of being bemoned, I am rather blamed, as a man of ſmall iudgement, that if you, and <hi>Galathee</hi> knew how bitter the wormewood is, wherewith I am fed, in this place, happy indeed to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but me, I aſſure my ſelfe, you would take pitty of my life. And what want you (ſaid ſhe) to comfort you? At this time (ſayd he) I only want leaue to be gon. Would you (replied the Nymph) I ſhould ſpeake of it to <hi>Galathee?</hi> I beſeech you (ſayd he) by whatſoeuer you hold deareſt. Then it muſt be as by your ſelfe (ſayd the Nymph) bluſhing: and not turning her head toward him, ſhe went out of the chamber to ſeeke where <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee</hi> was, whom ſhe found alone in the garden, and who now began to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect there was loue on <hi>Leonide's</hi> part, fearing ſhee nothing forwarded the charge ſhe had giuen her, though ſhe remained ſince all the day from him, for that knowing how ſharpe the weapons of the beauty of the ſhepherd were, ſhe thought it might as well part two as one: yet being conſtrained to paſſe thorow her hands, ſhe went about to deceiue her ſelfe, as well as was poſſible; and ſo ſet on the ſame countenance toward the Nymph, as ſhe had accuſtomed; and when ſhe ſaw her comming toward her, ſhee raiſed her ſelfe to aske how the ſhepheard did; and hauing knowne hee was in the ſame ſtate ſhe left him, ſhe held on her walke, and hauing gon ſome paces, without ſpeaking, ſhee turned to the Nymph, and ſayd, But
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:177519:45"/>
tell me, <hi>Leonide,</hi> was there euer man ſo inſenſible as <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſince neither my actions, nor your perſwaſions, can giue him any feeling of that hee ought to render me? For my part (anſwered <hi>Leonide)</hi> I had rather accuſe him of want of ſpirit, and courage, then of vnderſtanding; for I thinke, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he hath not the iudgement to know, whereto my actions tend, or if he know my words, he hath not the courage to attempt ſo high: and ſo, how much the loue of your perfections and fauours may raiſe him to you, ſo much the weight of his owne ſmall merit and condition may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe him. But you muſt not thinke this ſtrange, ſince the Appletree bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth Apples, and the Oake Acornes; for euery thing brings foorth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his nature: So, what can you hope the courage of a villaine can produce, but the deſignes of a weake and baſe ſoule? I thinke well, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Galathee,</hi> the great difference of our conditions do worke in him a great reſpect, but I ſhall neuer imagine, if he knew the difference, but he hath ſpirit enough to iudge, to what end I vſe him with this ſweete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, except it be, that hee be ſo farre engaged to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not goe backe.</p>
               <p>Aſſure you, Madame, replied <hi>Leonide,</hi> it is not reſpect, but ſottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which makes him ſo miſpriſing. For I may auerre, as you ſay, that it is true he loues <hi>Astrea;</hi> but if he had iudgement, would he not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne her for you, who deſerue ſo farre beyond compariſon? Yet is he ſo ill aduiſed, that at euery turne, when I ſpeake to him of you, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers me but with griefe, for being ſo farre remoued from his <hi>Astrea,</hi> with ſuch diſpleaſure, that one may thinke, that his ſtay here is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly troubleſome to him. And this morning, hearing him ſigh, I asked him the cauſe. He made me anſwer, which would moue the ſtones to pitty; and in the end, the concluſion was, that I ſhould deſire you he might be gone. Yes, replyed <hi>Galathee,</hi> red with choler, no longer able to diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble her iealouſie: Confeſſe the truth, <hi>Leonide,</hi> he hath mooued you. It is true, Madam, he hath moued me to pitty; and me thinkes, ſince he hath ſuch a deſire to be gone, you ought not to hold him by force. For Loue neuer enters into the heart for the blowes of a whip. I thinke not, reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Galathee,</hi> but he had moued you to pitty; but ſpeake no more of it: it may be, when he is recouerd, he ſhall ſooner find the effects of deſpight, which he hath cauſed to be bred in me, then thoſe of loue, which he hath wrought in you. In the meane time, to ſpeake freely, let him reſolue not to go hence at his owne pleaſure, but at mine. <hi>Leonide</hi> would haue an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, but the Nymph interrupted her. No more, <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſayd ſhee, it is enough, content your ſelfe that I ſay no more, but that this is my
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:177519:46"/>
reſolution. So <hi>Leonide</hi> was forced to hold her peace, and to be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gone, taking this iniurie ſo to heart, that ſhe reſolued to goe to <hi>Adamas</hi> her vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, and to take no more care of <hi>Galathees</hi> ſecrets, who at that time cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Siluie</hi> that was walking in another alley alone; to whom againſt her former purpoſe, ſhe could not hold, in complayning of <hi>Leonide,</hi> from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her know that, which till then ſhe had hid from her. But <hi>Siluie,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though young, yet full of iudgement, to pacifie all things, indeuoured to excuſe <hi>Leonide</hi> what ſhe could poſſibly; knowing well, that if her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion meant a deſpite, and it ſhould come to be knowne, they could not but bring much ſhame to their Miſtris. And therefore ſhe ſayd vnto her, after many words: You know well, Madam, you neuer acquainted me with this buſineſſe; and yet I muſt tell you, of theſe particulars you may not iudge me ſo ignorant as I ſeemed to be; but my humour is not to thruſt my ſelfe into things, where I am not called. It is ſome pretty while ſince, ſeeing my companion ſo diligent about <hi>Celadon,</hi> I ſuſpected that Loue was the cauſe, and not Compaſſion of his diſeaſe: and becauſe it is a thing that toucheth vs all, I reſolued to be aſſured before I would ſpeake of it; and after that, I beganne to looke into her actions more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly then of wont, and wrought ſo, that yeſterday I got on the furder ſide of the ſhepheards bed, while he ſlept, and by and by <hi>Leonide</hi> came in, who by opening the doore, waked him, without knowing any thing. After many co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon diſcourſes, ſhe came to talke of the loue he bareto the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Astrea,</hi> and <hi>Astrea</hi> to him: But (ſayd ſhe) beleeue me, this is nothing to the price of the affection that <hi>Galathee</hi> beares you. To me, (ſaid he?) Yes, to you (replyed <hi>Leonide:)</hi> and make it not ſo ſtrange, you know how often I haue told you; yet is ſhe greater then my words. Faire Nymph, anſwered the ſhepheard, I can neither merit, nor beleeue I ſhall haue ſo great happineſſe. Beſides, what ſhould her meaning be to me, that am a ſhepheard borne, and deſire to liue and die ſo? Your birth (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes my companion) cannot but be great, ſince it hath giuen beginning to ſo great perfections. O <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid then the ſhepheard, your words are full of mockery; but were they plaine, haue you an opinion, that I know not what <hi>Galathee</hi> is, &amp; who I am? I know it indeed, faire Nymph, and can well meaſure my meanneſſe, and her greatneſſe with duety. True (anſwered <hi>Leonide)</hi> I thinke you will vſe the meaſure that men doe, that is good for them that will buy and ſell. And doe not you know that gifts will not be meaſured? and Loue being nothing but a gift, why will you draw it to the ell-wand of duty? Doubt no more of that which I tell you and not to be wanting in your duty, render her as much of loue and of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:177519:46"/>
as ſhe hath giuen you. I ſweare vnto you, Madam, till that time, I imagined that <hi>Leonide</hi> ſpake for her ſelfe, and I haue no cauſe to lie; from the beginning this diſcourſe aſtoniſhed me: but ſince, hauing ſeene with what diſcretion your actions haue beene carried, I much commend the power you haue ouer them; knowing very well, that it is an harder mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to haue abſolute commaund ouer ones ſelfe, then ouer any other.</p>
               <p>Mayd (anſwered <hi>Galathee)</hi> if you knew the occaſion I haue to ſeek the loue of <hi>Celadon,</hi> you would commend it, and aduiſe mee to the ſame deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne: For, do you remember that Druyde that foretold vs our fortune? I remember it well, ſaid ſhe, it is not ſo long ſince. You know (continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Galathee)</hi> how many true things he hath told you, and <hi>Leonide</hi> alſo. Now know withall, that he aſſured me, that if I married any otherthen <hi>Celadon,</hi> I ſhould be the moſt vnhappy perſon on earth; and do you think it fit, that hauing had ſuch proofe of his predictions, I ſhould contemne them that touch me ſo neere? And this is it, that I finde ſuch fault with, that <hi>Leonide</hi> ſhould be ſo much miſaduiſed, to march my pace, making the ſame declaration to him. Madam, ſaid <hi>Siluie,</hi> enter not into that doubt, for in truth I lie not. And me thinkes you ſhould not anger her too much, for feare that in her complaints ſhe diſcouer this deſſigne to any other. Friend (ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> embracing her) I doubt not of that you told me, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe you, I will deale with <hi>Leonide,</hi> as you haue aduiſed me.</p>
               <p>In the meane time that they diſcourſe thus, <hi>Leonide</hi> goes to ſeek out <hi>Celadon,</hi> to whom ſhe recited, word for word, the talke that <hi>Galathee</hi> and ſhe had for his cauſe, and that he was to thinke that the place where hee was, bare the ſhew of liberty, but indeede it was a priſon: which ſtrucke him ſo to the quick, that whereas before his diſeaſe, he went but as it were creeping, now it grew ſo violent, that that very night the feauer took him againe ſo burning, that <hi>Galathee</hi> being come to ſee him, and ſeeing him ſo much impayred, was in great doubt of his life. The next morning his diſeaſe increaſing ſo fiercely, he ſwowned away twice or thrice betweene their armes: and albeit theſe Nymphs were neuer further off, but that the one was at the head, and the other at the feete of the bed, without other repoſe, then that by broken ſleepes extreme heauineſſe came ſtealing on them: yet ſo it was, that he was very poorely attended, hauing there nothing fit for a ſicke man; and not daring to fetch it elſe-where, for feare of being diſcouered. So that the ſhepheard ran in great hazard of his life, and in ſuch ſort, that that one night he felt himſelfe in great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſo that the Nymphs eſteemed him as a dead man; but in the end, hee came back to himſelfe, and ſhortly after loſt a great deale of bloud, which
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:177519:47"/>
weakened him ſo, that hee deſired to reſt. That was the cauſe that the Nymphs left him alone with <hi>Merill.</hi> And being retired, <hi>Siluie</hi> all afraid at this accident, addreſſing her ſelfe to <hi>Galathee,</hi> ſaid: Me thinkes (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam) you are ready to fall into a great confuſion, if you take not the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter order: Iudge how great paine it will be to you, if this ſhepheard periſh in your hands for fault of ſuccour.</p>
               <p>Alas (ſayd the Nymph) ſince the relapſe of his diſeaſe, I found it too true, that which you ſay: but what remedy is there? We are heere alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnprouided of things neceſſary for him, and to haue them from elſe-where, if my life lay on it, I would not doe it, for the feare I haue it would be knowne. <hi>Leonide,</hi> whom affection had made more reſolute then <hi>Siluie,</hi> ſayd: Madame, theſe feares are good, when they touch not the life of a man; but where it doth, we are not ſo much to conſider or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent other inconueniences which may ariſe. If this ſhepheard die, thinke you, his death can be kept vnknowne? Since it can ſort but to puniſhment, you muſt beleeue, the very heauens will diſcouer: but let vs take it at the worſt, and that it be knowne the ſhepheard be heere. What of that? May you not couer it with the cloke of Compaſſion, whereto Nature inclines vs all? And if it pleaſe you to referre this buſineſſe to me, I aſſure my ſelfe to carry it ſo diſcreetly, that no man ſhall diſcouer any thing. For Madam, I haue (as you know) for my vnkle, <hi>Adamas</hi> Prince of the Druydes, from whom no ſecret of Nature, nor vertue of hearbs are hidde; he is a man of great diſcretion and iudgement: and I know, he hath a particular inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to doe you ſeruice: if you will imploy him in this occaſion, I make no queſtion, but it will ſort to your contentment. <hi>Galathee</hi> ſtood ſome while without anſwer. But <hi>Siluie,</hi> that ſaw it the moſt expedient, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged, that by meane of the wiſe <hi>Adamas,</hi> they might diuert <hi>Galathee</hi> from this ſhamefull life, anſwered very readily, that this way, in her opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, was the ſafeſt. Whereto <hi>Galathee</hi> conſented, not being able to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent a better. There reſteth (ſaith <hi>Leonide)</hi> to know (that I goe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your commandement) what your will is I ſhould ſay to <hi>Adamas,</hi> &amp; what I ſhould conceale. There is nothing (anſwered <hi>Siluie,</hi> ſeeing <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee</hi> ſtand ſilent) that more binds a man to ſecreſie, then frankly to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer an intire truſt: and contrarily, nothing that more conſtraines to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray, then apparant miſtruſt: So that it ſeemeth beſt, to tie <hi>Adamas</hi> more ſtrongly to be ſecret, you muſt tell him before he comes, all things that he is like to diſcouer when he ſhall be here. I am (ſaid <hi>Galathee)</hi> ſo quite beſides my ſelfe, that I hardly know what to ſay: and for that cauſe, I referre all to your diſcretion. So departed <hi>Leonide</hi> with her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:177519:47"/>
though the beginning of the night were very darke, and reſted not till ſhe came to her vnkle, whoſe abode was at the turning of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of <hi>Marſellis,</hi> not farre from the Veſtals and Druides of <hi>Laignieu:</hi> but her iourney was longer then ſhe looked for, for reaching thither by breake of day, ſhe found he was gone to <hi>Feurs,</hi> and that he would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne of two or three dayes, which was the cauſe, that without long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, ſhee ſet forward on her way, but ſo weary, that had not the deſire of the ſhepheards recouery been, which gaue her no reſt, without doubt, ſhee had ſtayed for <hi>Adamas</hi> there, whereas now ſhee ſtayed but halfe an houre, for that not hauing beene vſed to ſuch iourney, ſhee found it very hard; &amp; when ſhe was a little refreſhed, ſhee went the ſame way ſhecame. But hardly had ſhe gone a mile, but ſhe might ſee farre oft, a Nymph alone comming towards her, the ſame way that ſhe had gone, whom afterwards ſhe knew to be <hi>Siluie.</hi> This meeting brought her but a little co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort; belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that ſhe came to deliuer the death of <hi>Celadon,</hi> but it was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary; for ſhe vnderſtood by her, that ſince her departure, he had taken good reſt, &amp; at his waking, he found himſelfe without the feuer, and therfore <hi>Galathee</hi> had ſent her to ouertake her, and to tell her ſo much; and to ſay, that the ſhepheard beeing in ſo good caſe, there was no neede to bring <hi>Adamas,</hi> nor to acquaint him with the buſineſſe. It will bee hard to expreſſe the contentment that <hi>Leonide</hi> had, hearing of the recouery of the ſhepheard, whom ſhe loued. And after ſhe had thanked God, ſhee ſaid to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, Siſter, ſince I know by your ſpeech, that <hi>Galathee</hi> hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from you her deſire which ſhee hath, touching the ſhepheard, it is neceſſary, that I ſhould frankly tell you, that this kinde of life infinitely diſtaſtes mee, and that I hold it very ſhamefull, both for her and vs: for ſhe is ſo paſſionate, that for all the ſmall reckoning the ſhepheard makes of her, yet can ſhe not with-hold her ſelfe; and ſo hath before her eyes, the predictions of a certaine Druide, that ſhee thinkes all her happineſſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends vpon this Loue: and this is the good which ſhe thinkes euery one ought to affect as well as ſhe, as if all looked with her eyes; and that is my griefe: for ſhe is become ſo iealous of me, that ſhe can hardly indure me to be neere him. Now, ſiſter, if this life come to be knowne (as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt it will, ſince there is nothing ſo ſecret, but ſhall be diſcouered) iudge you what they will talke of vs, and what opinion wee ſhall haue of all others that heare of it. I haue done what I could poſſibly to diuert her from it, but all to no purpoſe. Therefore am I reſolued to let her loue, ſince ſhe will loue; prouided, that it be not at our coſt. I haue made you this diſcourſe, to ſhew you, that it is very expedient, we ſhould ſeek ſome
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:177519:48"/>
remedy; and that I finde no meane more ready, then by making my vnkle a party, who will bring it to good paſſe by his counſell and wiſedome. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſaid <hi>Siluie,</hi> I infinitely commend your deſine; and to giue you the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of bringing <hi>Adamas</hi> to her, I will returne backe, and ſay, I haue beene at <hi>Adamas</hi> his houſe, but could neither finde you nor him. It were very fit (anſwered <hi>Leonide)</hi> that we go to reſt our ſelues in ſome thicket, that as it ſeemeth, you haue long ſought for me; ſo am I ſo weary, that I muſt ſleepe a little, if I meane to finiſh my voyage. Let vs goe, ſiſter (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Siluie)</hi> and beleeue you ſhall effect no ſmall matter, to free vs of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon:</hi> For, I well perceiue the humour of <hi>Galathee,</hi> that with the time, will turne to your great diſpleaſure. At this word they tooke hands, and looking about for ſome place to ſpend a part of the day in, they ſpyed one on the other ſide of <hi>Lignon,</hi> which they thought fit for their purpoſe. Paſſing ouer the bridge of the <hi>Botreſſe,</hi> and leauing <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> the place of the Druides and Veſtals on the left hand, and going downe along the riuer, they came to beſtow themſelues in a thicke groue, which ioyned hard on the high-way, and wherein there was an Arbor, that affoorded a pleaſant ſeate at all times; out of which, when they had made choyce of the moſt ſhadowed corner, they fell aſleepe one after another.</p>
               <p>And while they thus reſted, <hi>Aſtrea, Diane,</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> came by chance, driuing their flocks into that place, and not ſeeing the Nymphs, they ſate downe neere them: and becauſe the amities which are begunne in bad fortune, are more ſtraightly riuited in, then thoſe that are conceiued in happy times, <hi>Diane,</hi> who was tyed in a faſt league with <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſince the miſ-hap of <hi>Celadon,</hi> bare them ſo great good will, and they to her, that almoſt all the day they left not each other: and, indeed, <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had great neede of conſolation; the rather, for that about that time, ſhee loſt <hi>Alce</hi> and <hi>Hippolite,</hi> her father and mother: <hi>Hippolite,</hi> for the fright ſhotooke for the loſſe of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> when ſhe was in the water; and <hi>Alce,</hi> for griefe, at the loſſe of his deare companion: which yet was a poore helpe to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who might bewaile the loſſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> vnder the couer of that of her father and mother: and, as I told you, <hi>Diane,</hi> the daughter of the wiſe <hi>Bellinde,</hi> that ſhe might not bee wanting in the duty of a neighbour, went often to viſite her, and found her humour ſo pleaſing, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine hers, and <hi>Phillis</hi> that of them both, that they ſware ſo firme a league betweene them, that they neuer after ſeparated: and this was the firſt day that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> came out of her lodging. So that theſe her two faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full companions were now with her: but they were no ſooner ſet down, but they might perceiue farre off, <hi>Semire,</hi> who came to finde her. This
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:177519:48"/>
ſhepheard had long time beene amorous of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and knowing that ſhe loued <hi>Celadon,</hi> thought that he was the cauſe of his bad ſucceſſe; beeing now perſwaded, that hauing driuen away <hi>Celadon,</hi> he might eaſily obtain his place, he came to ſeeke her out, that he might beginne his deſigne, but he was much deceiued; for <hi>Aſtrea</hi> hauing found out his craft, concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſuch an hatred againſt him, that when ſhee ſpyed him, ſhee would lay her hand ouer her eyes, that ſhe might not ſee him, and deſired <hi>Phillis</hi> to tell him from her, that he ſhould neuer preſent himſelfe to her. And theſe words were ſpoken with ſuch a change of looke, and ſo great a vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that her companions eaſily found out her great ſtomake, which more readily incenſed <hi>Phillis</hi> againſt the ſhepherd. When he heard this meſſage, heſtood ſo confuſed in his thoughts, that it ſeemed he could not moue. At laſt, ouercome, &amp; enforced by the acknowledgement of his error, he ſaid, Diſcreete <hi>Phillis,</hi> I proteſt, the heauens are iuſt, in giuing me more ſorrow then an heart is able to beare, ſince they cannot equall their puniſhment according to mine offence, hauing beene the cauſe of the breach of the faireſt and moſt intire loue that euer was. But that the gods may not more rigorouſly chaſtiſe me, tell this faire ſhepheardeſſe, that I aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don both of her, and of the cinders of <hi>Celadon,</hi> aſſuring her, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme affection which I bare her, without more, was the cauſe of this fault; that baniſhed from her, and from her eyes, iuſtly offended, I may goe lamenting all my life long. At this word hee went away ſo vncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, that his repentance mooued <hi>Phillis</hi> to ſome pittie: and beeing come backe to her companions, ſhee told them his anſwer. Alas! ſiſter, ſayd <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I haue more reaſon to fly this wicked man, then to weepe; iudge you if I ought not, this is he, without more, that hath beene the cauſe of all my ſorrow. How? ſiſter, ſaid ſhe, is <hi>Semire</hi> the cauſe of your ſorrow? Hath he ſuch power ouer you? If I durſt tell you his wickednes, ſayd <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> and mine owne folly, you would ſay, that he hath vſed the greateſt Arte, that the craftieſt ſpirit could inuent. <hi>Diane</hi> knowing that that was the cauſe that ſhe ſpake no more plainely to <hi>Phillis,</hi> for that it was yet but eight or ten dayes that they grew to that familiarity, ſaid to them, that it was no part of her purpoſe, to take any thing from them by conſtraint. And you, faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid ſhee, turning to the ſad <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> giue me occaſion to thinke that you loue me not, if you be more reſerued to me then to <hi>Phillis;</hi> for that, though it be not long, that I haue inioyed the good of your familiarity, yet are you to be no leſſe aſſured of my affection, then of hers, <hi>Phillis</hi> then anſwered, I aſſure my ſelfe, that <hi>Aſtrea</hi> will alwayes ſpeake as freely before you, as before her ſelfe; her
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:177519:49"/>
humor being not to loue by halues; &amp; ſince ſhe hath ſworne to be ſuch, ſhe hath nothing in her ſoule to conceale. It is true (continued <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> and that which held me from ſaying more, was onely for that the putting the weapon againe into the wound, will but poyſon it. Yet ſo it is, replied <hi>Diane,</hi> that oftentimes you muſt vſe the weapon to heale it: and for me, I thinke, that to ſpeake freely of the diſeaſe to a friend, is, to make him a party: and if I durſt deſire you, it would be a great ſatisfaction, to know, what your life hath beene, as my ſelfe alſo will not make it dainty, to tell you mine, when you ſhall be deſirous to know it. Since you will haue it ſo, anſwered <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> &amp; that you haue a mind to partake in my ſorrowes, I will, ſo that afterwards you impart to me of your contentments, and that, in the meane time, you ſuffer me to vſe that breuity in the diſcourſe, which you deſire to vnderſtand from me; and truly, an hiſtory ſo vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate as mine, will not pleaſe, but by being ſhort: And being all three ſet in a round, ſhe began to ſpeake in this manner:</p>

                  <p>THey that know what it is, when friendſhip or hatted paſſe from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſon, may well conceiue <hi>Celadons</hi> fortune and mine, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, may affirme, that they be not deceiued: For (faire <hi>Diane)</hi> I beleeue you haue often heard ſpeech of the old hatred betweene <hi>Alce</hi> &amp; <hi>Hippolite,</hi> my father and mother, and of <hi>Alcippe</hi> and <hi>Amarillis,</hi> the father &amp; mother of <hi>Celadon,</hi> their diſpleaſures accompanying them euen to their graue, which hath beene cauſe of ſo great trouble among the ſhepheards of this Country, that I aſſure my ſelfe, there is no man ignorant of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the ſhore of the cruell and diſhonoured <hi>Lignon.</hi> And yet it ſeemeth that Loue, to ſhew his power of perſons ſo oppoſite, would vnite two ſo ſtraitly, that nothing could breake the lines, but death. For, hardly had <hi>Celadon</hi> reached to the age of foureteene or fifteene yeeres, and I of twelue or thirteene, but that at an aſſembly which was had at the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Venus,</hi> which is on the top of this mountaine, ſeated in the Plaine, right ouer againſt <hi>Montſur,</hi> about a mile from the Caſtle of <hi>Monbuſor,</hi> this young ſhepheard ſawe me: and as he hath told me ſince, he had long before conceiued a good liking, vpon the report which was made of me. But the let which I told you, our fathers tooke from him all meanes, and I muſt tell you, that I do not thinke he bare a greater liking, then did I; for I know not how, when I heard ſpeech of him, my heart danced in my belly; and this was but a preſage of the troubles, which ſince befell mee
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:177519:49"/>
on that occaſion, Now at the inſtant, when he ſaw me, I know not how he found matter of loue in mee, ſo that within a while after, hee reſolued to loue me, and to ſerue me.</p>
                  <p>And it ſeemeth that at this firſt view, both the one and the other of vs was at this paſſe, that wee muſt loue, ſo that as often as it was told mee, that hee was the ſonne of <hi>Alcippe,</hi> I found a certaine change in my ſelfe, which was not ordinary, and thenceforth all his actions began to pleaſe me, and much more agreeing to my liking, then of all the other yong ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards of his age: and for that as yet he durſt not come neere me, &amp; that ſpeech was denied him, his lookes at his commings and goings ſpake to me ſo often, that at laſt I knew he had a longing to tell me more; and to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it, at a game that was kept at the foot of the mountaine, vnder the old elmes, that yeelded a pleaſant ſhade, he vſed ſuch arte, that before I was aware, and ſeeming to bee through want of heed, hee got vnder my hand; for my part I ſeemed not to note it, &amp; vſed him as I did al the others; but he on the contrary, tooke mee by the hand, ſo that making ſhewe to caſt downe his, I perceiued his mouth on mine. This act made me bluſh, and making ſhew not to heed it, I turned my head away as hearkening to the brawle: we danced. This was the cauſe that he ſtayd ſomewhile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſpake to me, not knowing as I thinke where to begin. At laſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to loſe this opportunity, which he had ſo long ſought, he aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced himſelfe before me, and rounded in the care of <hi>Corilas,</hi> that led me in that da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, ſo loud, yet faining to whiſper, that I heard theſe words: I wold to God, <hi>Corilas,</hi> the contention betweene the father of this ſhepheardeſſe, &amp; mine, might be ended in vs two: and then went to his place. And <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las</hi> anſwered him loud enough: Make not you this attempt, <hi>Celadon;</hi> for it may bee, you neuer attempted any thing more dangerous. What ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard ſo euer it hath (anſwered <hi>Celadon</hi> aloud) I will not deny that I haue ſpoken, &amp; giue my hart in pawne. In ſuch promiſes (replied <hi>Corilas)</hi> they vſe not to offer leſſe aſſurance then that: &amp; yet within a while after, it is gaineſaid. Whoſoeuer (reioyneth the ſhepheard) makes difficulties to run ſuch a fortune as you threaten, I ſhal hold him for a man of ſmall courage. It is a vertue (anſwered <hi>Corilas)</hi> to be couragious, but it is alſo a folly to be raſh. By proofe (replied <hi>Celadon)</hi> you ſhall know what I will do, and in the meane time, I promiſe you at a word, that I will neuer gaineſay it. And becauſe I made ſhew, not to heed their diſcourſe, directing his words to me, he ſayd, And you, faire ſhepheardeſſe, what is your opinion? I know not, anſwerd I, of what you ſpeake. He hath told me, ſayd <hi>Corilas,</hi> that to draw a great good out of a great euill, hee wiſhes your fathers ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:177519:50"/>
were changed into loue betweene their children. How (anſwerd I, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming not to know him) are you the ſonne of <hi>Alcippe?</hi> And hauing anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me, Yea, and moreouer, my ſeruant? Me thinks ſayd I, it were fitter for you to ioyne to ſome other, that may haue more occaſion to agree with you, then I. I haue heard it ſayd (replied <hi>Celadon)</hi> that the gods do puniſh the offences of the fathers on their children; but among men, it hath not bene the cuſtome: which is not, for that it is not allowed to your beauty, which is diuine, to vſe the ſame preuiledges that the gods do: but if it bee ſo, you are like then to grant pardon, when it is demanded of you. Is it ſo, ſhepheard (interrupted <hi>Corilas)</hi> that you begin your combat with crying mercy? In this combat (anſwered he) to be ouercome, is a kind of victory: &amp; for my part, I am willing enough, prouided that ſhe wil take the ſpoyle. I thinke they had continued their diſcourſe longer, if the dance had held out longer, but the end of it ſeparated vs, and euery one went to his place.</p>
                  <p>Somewhile after they began to propound prizes, for diuers exerciſes which they were accuſtomed vnto, as the Lute, to Runne, and caſt the Barre; whereto <hi>Celadon,</hi> for being too yong, was not admitted but only to the courſe whereat he won the prize, which was a garland of diuers flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which was ſet on his head by the whole aſſembly, with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, that being ſo yong had ouercome ſo many ſhepheards: Hee, without any long dreaming, tooke it off, came to me to ſet it on my head, ſaying very low, See the confirmation of what I ſayd! I was ſo ſurprized, that I could not anſwere: &amp; had it not bene for <hi>Artemis</hi> your mother, <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> I had giuen it him againe; not for that comming from his hand, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed me not, but becauſe I feared <hi>Alce</hi> &amp; <hi>Hippolite</hi> would not think wel of it. But <hi>Artemis,</hi> that rather deſired to quench, then kindle theſe ancient hatreds, commanded me to take it and to thanke him: which I did ſo cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that euery one might well thinke it ſhould not haue bene done, but by the command of my Aunt. All this day paſſed thus, &amp; the next day alſo, the yong ſhepheard loſing no occaſion to make his affection appeare to me. And becauſe that on the third day they had a cuſtome to repreſent, in honor of <hi>Venus,</hi> the iudgement which <hi>Paris</hi> gaue of the three goddeſſes, <hi>Celadon</hi> reſolued to thruſt himſelfe among the maids, vnder the habit of a ſhepheardeſſe. You know well, that on that third day, about the end of the feaſt of the great Druide, they haue vſed to caſt among the maids an apple of gold, whereon are written the names of the three ſhepheardeſſes whom they thinke to be the moſt faire in the company, with this word,
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Be it giuen to the most faire of the three:</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:177519:50"/>
And that, after they haue dreſſed her, which is to repreſent the perſon of <hi>Paris,</hi> who with the three ſhepheardeſſes enter into the Temple of <hi>Beauty,</hi> dedicated to <hi>Venus,</hi> where, the doores being ſhut, ſhee giueth iudgement of all three, when ſhe ſees them naked, but onely a thinne Lawne, which couers them, from the girdle-ſtead, almoſt to the knees. And for that once it was abuſed, and that ſome ſhepheards had thruſt themſelues among the ſhepheardeſſes, it was ordayned by a publique Edict, That he that did commit the like fault, ſhould (without remiſſion) be ſtoned by the Maides at the gate of the Temple:</p>
                  <p>Now it hapned, that this Youth (without conſideration of the great danger) that day attired himſelfe like a ſhepheardeſſe, and forcing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe into our company, was taken for a maide; and as Fortune would fauour him, my name was written on the Apple, and <hi>Malthe</hi> and <hi>Stella;</hi> and when they came to ſet downe the name of her that bare the perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage of <hi>Paris,</hi> I heard him name <hi>Orithee,</hi> which was the name that <hi>Celadon</hi> had taken. God knowes if his ſoule receiued not all the delight it was capable of, when he ſawe his deſſigne ſucceed ſo well. In the end, we were brought into the Temple, where the Iudge being ſet in his ſeat, the doores being ſhut, and we three onely remayning with him, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne, according to the order, to vnclothe ourſelues; and becauſe euery one muſt go apart, and ſpeake to him, and make the offers that the three goddeſſes had ſometimes made to <hi>Paris; Stelle,</hi> who was moſt forward to put off her clothes, went firſt to preſent her ſelfe to him, whom he beheld ſome while: And after he had heard what ſhe would ſay, he cauſed her to returne, to giue place to <hi>Malthe,</hi> who was got before me, for that aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſhew my ſelfe naked, I delayed (as much as I could) the putting off of my clothes. <hi>Celadon,</hi> thinking the time long, and after he had ſome ſhort while entertayned <hi>Malthe,</hi> ſeeing that I came not, called for mee. In the end, not able to delay it no longer, I was conſtrained; but, O God, when I thinke on it, I am yet ready to die for ſhame: yet my haire was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and almoſt couered mee, on it I had no other ornament, then the garland, which the day before hee had giuen me. When the others were gone backe, and when he ſaw me in this ſort; by him I obſerued that twice or thrice he changed colour, but I neuer ſuſpected the cauſe: for my part, ſhamefaſtneſſe had tainted my cheek with ſo freſh a colour, that hee hath ſince ſworne vnto me, he neuer ſaw me ſo louely: and he would haue beene contented, hee might haue beene ſuffered to ſtay all the day long in that contemplation: but fearing to be diſcouerd, he was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his contentment: and when he ſaw I ſaid nothing, (for ſhame had tied
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:177519:51"/>
vp my tongue) And how, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſayd het, hinke you your cauſe ſo good, that you need not as well as others, ſeek the Iudges good will? I doubt not, <hi>Orithee,</hi> anſwered I, that I ſhall haue more need to ſeduce my Iudge by my words, then <hi>Stella</hi> or <hi>Malthe:</hi> but I know wel alſo, that I muſt as well giue place to them in perſwading, as in beauty: ſo that but for the conſtraint whereto the cuſtome tyes mee, I had neuer come before you, in hope to win the prize. And if you beare it away (anſwered the ſhepheard) what will you do for me? I ſhall haue, ſayd I, the greater obligation to you, by how much I thinke it merits leſſe. How then, replied he, will you make me no other offer? The demand (ſayd I) muſt come from you, for I cannot teach you who deſerues to be receiued. Sweare to me, ſaid the ſhepheard, you will giue me that which I ſhall demand, and my iudgement ſhall be to your aduantage. After I had promiſed him, hee asketh of my haire, to make him a bracelet: which I did; and after he had folded it in a paper, hee ſayd to me: Now, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I will keepe theſe haires for a pledge of the oth which you haue made, that if euer you gaineſay it, I may offer it to the goddeſſe <hi>Venus,</hi> and demand vengeance of her. That, ſayd I, is ſuperfluous, ſince I am reſolued neuer to faile. Then with a ſmlling countenance, hee ſayd to me, God be thanked, faire <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that my deſigne hath falne out ſo proſperouſly: for know, that which you haue promiſed me, is to loue me aboue any in the world, and to receiue me as your faithfull ſeruant, who am <hi>Celadon,</hi> and not <hi>Orithee,</hi> as you ſuppoſe; I ſay, that <hi>Celadon,</hi> by whom loue hath giuen proofe, that hatred is not of power ſufficient to diſappoint his effects, ſince euen among the diſpleaſures of our fathers, he hath made me ſo yours, that I had no feare to dye at the gate of this temple, to giue you teſtimony of my affection. Iudge, wiſe <hi>Diane,</hi> what became of mee: for loue forbade me to ſeeke reuenge of my ſhamefaſtnes; and yet ſhame encouraged mee againſt loue: at laſt, after a confuſed diſputation, it was impoſſible for me to conſent to cauſe him dye, ſince the offence which he made, proceeded not but of too great loue to me: yet knowing him to be a ſhepheard, I could no longer ſtay before his eies; and without making o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther anſwere, I ranne to my companions, whom I found almoſt dreſſed; and taking vp my garments, ſcarce knowing what I did, I made my ſelfe ready as ſoone as was poſſible. But to be ſhort, when we were all ready, the diſſembled <hi>Orithee</hi> placed her ſelfe at the entry of the gate; and hauing vs all three before her: I ordaine (ſaith ſhe) that the prize of beauty be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> in witneſſe whereof I preſent her the golden apple: &amp; there is no cauſe any body ſhould doubt of my iudgement, ſince I haue ſeene her; and though a maide, yet, I haue felt the force. In ſaying thoſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:177519:51"/>
words, he preſented mee the apple, which I receiued, being much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; and the father, when with a loude voyce he ſayd, Receiue this Apple as a pawne of my affection, which is as infinite, as this is round. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered him, Be content, raſh man, that I receiue it to ſaue thy life: and that otherwiſe I would refuſe it, as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from thy hand. He durſt not reply, for feare he might be heard and knowne: and becauſe the cuſtome was, that ſhe that receiued the Apple, was to kiſſe the Iudge, by way of thankefulneſſe, I was conſtrayned to kiſſe him: but I aſſure you, had I not knowne him vntill then, I ſhould then haue diſcouered him to be a ſhepheard: for it was not the kiſſe of a maide.</p>
                  <p>Preſently, the noyſe, and the applauſe of the company ſeparated vs, becauſe the Druyde hauing crowned me, cauſed mee to be borne in a chaire to the place of the Aſſembly, with ſo much honour, that euery one wondered I was no more cheerefull. But I was ſo troubled, and ſo ſore beaten, betweene Loue and Deſpite, that I ſcarce knew what I did. As for <hi>Celadon,</hi> as ſoone as he had finiſhed the ceremonies, he loſt himſelfe amongſt the other ſhepheardeſſes, and by little and little, without the heeding of any body, got out of the company, and put off his borrowed garments, to put on his owne naturall clothes, with which hee came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne to vs; with a face ſo confident, that no man would euer haue ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him. As for me, when I ſawe him, I might ſcarce turne mine eyes to him, being full of ſhame and choler. But he that noted it, and made no ſhew of it, found the meanes to come to me, and to ſay loude enough; The Iudge which hath giuen you the prize of beauty, hath ſhewed good iudgement; and me thinkes, that albeit the Iuſtice of your cauſe do well deſerue ſo fauourable a ſentence, yet muſt not you be fayling to beare him ſome kinde of obligation. I beleeue, ſhepheard, anſwered I ſoftly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that he is more obliged to me, then I to him: for that if he gaue me an apple, which (in ſome ſort) was due to me, I haue giuen him life, which his raſhneſſe merited to loſe. So he told me (anſwered preſently <hi>Celadon)</hi> that hee would preſerue it onely for your ſeruice. If I had not more reſpect (replyed I) to my ſelfe, then to him, I had not let him goe without chaſticement for ſo great a preſumption. But enough, <hi>Celadon,</hi> let vs cut off this diſcourſe, and content your ſelfe, that if I haue not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed you as you deſerue, it was onely for feare of giuing occaſion to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to talke their pleaſure of me, and not for want of will to ſee you pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. If there be nothing but that (ſayd he) to hinder my death, tell me in what faſhion you will haue me die, and you ſhall ſee I haue no leſſe courage to ſatisfie you, then I haue had of loue to offend you. This diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:177519:52"/>
would be too long, if I ſhould tell you all our talke in particular.</p>
                  <p>So it was, that after many replies now on the one ſide and the other, whereby it was impoſſible for me to doubt of his affection, if at leaſt the diuers changes of countenance might bewray any thing I ſayde to him ſeeming to be in choler: Bethinke you, ſhepheard, of the hatred of our fathers, and beleeue, that that which I beare, ſhall not turne to nothing, if you euer more importune me with your follies, which your young age, and my honour, pardon for this time. I vſed theſe laſt words, to giue him the leſſe courage. For it is true, that his beauty, courage, and affection pleaſed me; and that he might make no further anſwer, I turned to talke with <hi>Stella,</hi> who was not farre off. He all aſtonied with this anſwer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from the company, ſo ſad, that in few dayes he was ſcarce to be knowne, &amp; ſo ſolitary, that his haunt was in the places moſt deſolate and ſauage of all our woods. Whereof being aduertiſed by ſome of my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who told me, without conceit, that I was the cauſe; I began to thinke of his paine, and reſolued in my minde, to ſearch ſome meanes to giue him ſatisfaction. And becauſe (as I told you) he forſooke all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, I was conſtrayned (that I might meet him) to driue my flocke that way where I knew he reſorted moſt. And when it fell out twice or thrice to be in vaine, at laſt, one day, as I was ſeeking for him, me thought, I heard his voyce among ſome trees: and I was not deceiued; for comming ſoftly towards him, I ſawe him lye along on the ground, and his eies wet teares, ſo bent vpward to heauen, that they ſeemed vnmooueable.</p>
                  <p>The ſight of him mooued me ſo to pittie, beeing ſomewhat inclined thereto before, that I reſolued no longer to leaue him in this paine. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after I had conſidered of it awhile, and not willing it might appeare to him that I ſought him out, I withdrew ſome good way from the place, whereſeeming not to heede him, I ſung ſo high, that my voyce came to his eares. As ſoone as he heard me, I might ſee hee raiſed vp himſelfe in a dumpe, and turning his eyes to the place where I was, hee ſtood like one rauiſhed to heare me, which when I marked, that I might giue him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity to come neere me, I made as though I would ſleepe, and yet I held mine eyes halfe open, to ſee what it would come to; and, indeed, it failed not of that I purpoſed: for comming ſoftly towards me, he came &amp; knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as cloſe to me as hee could, and after hee had long time ſtayed in this ſort, when I made ſhew to be faſt aſleepe, to giue him the more hardines, I perceiued, that after ſome ſighes, hee ſtoopes downe ſoftly againſt my mouth, and kiſſes me. Then thinking he had taken courage enough, I o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened mine eyes, as if I had beene waked when he touched me; and riſing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:177519:52"/>
vp, I ſayd to him, ſeeming to bee angry, Vnciuill ſhepheard, what hath made thee ſo vnmannerly, to come to diſquiet my ſleepe in this ſort? He then, al trembling, and not raiſing his knees, It is you, faire ſhepheardeſſe, ſaid he, that haue conſtrained me, and if I haue offended, you muſt puniſh your own perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, which are the cauſe. Theſe are alwaies, ſaid I, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes of your malipertneſſe: but if you holde on to diſpleaſe mee thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it, ſhepheard, I will not beare it. If you call it a diſpleaſure, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he, to be loued, and adored, in good time beginne to ſtudy, what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment you will inflict on mee; for, now I ſweare vnto you, that I ſhall diſpleaſe you in this ſort all my life, and no rigor of your cruelty, nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our fathers, nor any let in the world can diuert mee from this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne.</p>
                  <p>But, faire <hi>Diane,</hi> I muſt ſhorten theſe pleaſing diſcourſes, being ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the vnfortunate ſeaſon wherein I am, and muſt onely tell you, that in the end, being ouercome, I ſaid to him, But, ſhepheard, what end is your deſigne like to haue, ſince that they which may frame you to their pleaſure, diſallow it? How, replyed he preſently, Frame to their pleaſure? So farre is it that <hi>Alcippe</hi> hath power ouer my will, that I haue it not my ſelfe. You may diſpoſe of your ſelfe, ſaid I, at your owne pleaſure, but not of the obedience you owe to your father, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting a great fault. The obedience, anſwered he, which I owe him, may not paſſe that which I can ouer my ſelfe: for this is no faulting, not to doe that which one cannot. But be it ſo, that I owe him it, ſince of two euils wee are to ſhun the greateſt, I chooſe rather to be failing toward him, that is but a man, then againſt your beauty which is diuine. Our diſcourſe, in the end, held on ſo farre, that I muſt ſuffer him to be my ſeruant; and becauſe wee were young, both the one and the other, ſo that we had not Arte enough to couer our deſigne, <hi>Alcippe,</hi> within a while, took notice of it, &amp; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing that this loue ſhould paſſe further on, he reſolued with his old friend <hi>Cleante,</hi> to cauſe him to vndertake a iourney ſo long, that abſence might blot out this young impreſſion of Loue. But this diſtance auay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as little, as all the other crafty tricks with which hee ſerued himſelfe ſince. For <hi>Celadon,</hi> though hee were young, yet had a reſolution to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all difficulties: that, whereas others others meete their contraries with paine, hee tooke them for trials of himſelfe, and called them the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones of his faithfulneſſe: and for as much as he knew, his voyage would be long, he deſired me to giue him the commodity to bid me adieu. I did it, faire <hi>Diane,</hi> but if you had ſeene the affection, wherewith hee beſought me to loue him; the oathes, by which he aſſured me neuer to change; and
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:177519:53"/>
the coniurations, by which hee bound mee neuer to loue other; without doubt, you would iudge, that things moſt impoſſible, might fall out ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then the loſſe of this amity. In the end, not daring to ſtay longer, he ſaid, My <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> for ſo hee did in priuate call mee, I leaue you my brother <hi>Licidas,</hi> from who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I haue not concealed any one of my deſignes; he knows what ſeruice I haue vowed vnto you: promiſe me, if it pleaſe you, that I may depart with contentment, to receiue, as comming from mee, all theſe ſeruices that he ſhall doe you, and that, by his preſence, you renew the memory of <hi>Celadon.</hi> And, indeed, he had reaſon to make this requeſt: for <hi>Licidas,</hi> during his abſence, ſhewed himſelfe ſo curious to obſerue what his brother had giuen him in charge, that many thought he ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the affection which his brother bare me. That was the cauſe that <hi>Alcippe,</hi> after he had kept him three yeeres out of this Countrey, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him back, being of opinion, that ſo long a time had defaced the light impreſſion, which Loue had made in a ſoule ſo young; and that growing more wiſe, hee might eaſily draw <hi>Licidas</hi> from affecting me. But his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne was a ſtrong aſſurance to me of his faithfulneſſe: For the chilneſſe of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> which he had twice paſſed thorow, could nothing diminiſh the fire of his loue; nor the admirable beauties of thoſe <hi>Romanes,</hi> diuert him from the leaſt part of what he had promiſed me. O God, with what contentment came he to meete me! he beſought me by his brother, that I would giue him opportunity to ſpeake with me. I thinke I haue yet his letter. Alas! I haue more charily preſerued that which came from him, then himſelfe. And then ſhe drew out letters which ſhe had receiued from him, and pulling out the firſt (for they were all layd in order) after ſhe had wiped her eyes, ſhe read theſe words:</p>

                  <p>Faire <hi>Diane,</hi> it is impoſſible I ſhould remember the diſcourſe which we had, without wounding my ſelfe, ſo that the leaſt ſtroke is as greeuous to me as death. During the abſence of <hi>Celadon, Artemis</hi> my Aunt, and the mother of <hi>Phillis,</hi> came to ſee her kinsfolke, and brought with her this ſhepheardeſſe, poynting to <hi>Phillis.</hi> And becauſe our faſhion of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:177519:53"/>
better pleaſed them then that of the ſhepheards of <hi>Alleer,</hi> ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to dwell with vs, which was no ſmall contentment to vs: for by this meanes we grew familiar, and though the friendſhip was not ſo ſtrait, as it fell out afterward, yet her humour ſo pleaſed me, that I paſſed ouer many vnquiet houres reaſonably well with her. And when <hi>Celadon</hi> was returned, and that he had ſome while conuerſed with her, he gaue ſo good a iudgement, that I may truely ſay, he is the ground of the ſtrait amity which hath ſince beene betweene her and me. It was about this time, that he being of the age of ſeuenteene or eighteeneyeeres, &amp; I of fifteene or ſixteene, we beganne to carry our ſelues with more wiſedome, ſo that (to hide our loue) I intreated him, or rather, I conſtrayned him, to make loue to all the ſhepheardeſſes that had any ſhew of beauty, that the ſuite he made to mee, might be iudged to be rather common then particular. I ſay, I conſtrayned him, becauſe I thinke, but for his brother <hi>Licidas,</hi> he would neuer haue giuen his conſent. For, after he had many times falne on his knees before me, to call backe the charge I gaue him, in the end, his brother told him, that it was neceſſary for my contentment it ſhould be ſo: and that if he knew no other remedy, he might therein helpe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his imagination: and when he ſpake to others, he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit to himſelfe, it was to me. Alas, the poore ſhepheard had good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to make ſuch difficulty; for he ouer-well foreſaw, that from it would ariſe the cauſe of his death. Excuſe me (wiſe <hi>Diane)</hi> if my teares interrupt my diſcourſe, ſeeing I haue ſo iuſt cauſe, that it were impiety to forbid them me. And after ſhe had dryed her eyes, ſhee renewed her diſcourſe in this manner:</p>
                  <p>And becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi> was vſually with me, it was ſhe to whom, at the firſt, he addreſſed himſelfe, but with ſuch inforcement, that I could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refraine from laughter: and becauſe <hi>Phillis</hi> thought he was in earneſt, and that ſhe vſed him, as they ordinarily doe him that beginneth to be a ſuiter, I remember, that ſeeing himſelfe rudely handled, he often ſung this ſong which he made on that ſubiect.</p>

Siſter (interrupted <hi>Phillis)</hi> I remember it well you ſpeake of, and I ſhall make you laugh at the manner of his ſpeech to me. For, for the moſt part, it was with ſuch broken language, that we had need of an Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to make vs vnderſtand them; and vſually when he was to name mee, he would call me <hi>Astrea.</hi> But ſee what our inclination is! I knew well that Nature had (in ſome ſort) preferred <hi>Celadon</hi> before <hi>Licidas,</hi> yet not being able to tell you the reaſon <hi>Licidas</hi> was more welcome to me. Alas ſiſter, (ſayd <hi>Astrea)</hi> you bring to my remembrance the ſpeech, which he vſed about that time of you, and of this faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſayd ſhe) turning to <hi>Diane.</hi> Faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid he to me) the wiſe <hi>Bellinde,</hi> and your Aunt <hi>Artemis,</hi> are infinitely happy, in hauing ſuch daughters: and our <hi>Lignon</hi> is much bound to them, ſince (by their meanes) it hath the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe to ſee vpon her ſhores theſe two faire &amp; wiſe ſhepheardeſſes. And beleeue me, if I know any thing, they only deſerue the amity of <hi>Aſtrea:</hi> and therefore I aduiſe you to loue them: for I perceiue by that little know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I haue of them, that you ſhall finde great contentment in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity. Would to God, one of them would vouchſafe to reſpect my brother <hi>Licidas,</hi> with the like affection that I beare. And for that at that time I had no great knowledge of you (fayre <hi>Diane)</hi> I anſwered, that I deſired he ſhould rather ſerue <hi>Phillis;</hi> and it fell out as I wiſhed: for the ordinary conuerſation he had with her, at the firſt brought forth famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity betweene them, and at laſt he loued in earneſt. One day, when he found her at leiſure, he reſolued to declare his affection with much loue, and with the feweſt words he could. Faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid he) you haue knowledge enough of your ſelues to beleeue, that thoſe which loue you, can not but loue you infinitely. It can not be, that my actions, haue giuen you any knowledge of my affection, for the little you know of it, ſince none can loue you but in extremity, you may ſweare, that my loue is wonderfull great: and yet being ſuch, I demaund of you, as yet, but a beginning of good will. <hi>Celadon</hi> and I were ſo neere, that we could well heare this declaration, and the anſwere alſo that <hi>Phillis</hi> gaue him, which indeede was more rude then I expected from her. For long time before, ſhe and I well enough knew, by the eyes and actions of <hi>Licidas,</hi> that he was in loue with her; and we haue often talked of it, and I haue found in her, rather goodwill to him, then otherwiſe: yet at this brunt ſhe anſwered him ſo bitterly, that <hi>Licidas</hi> went away in deſpayre. And <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who loued his brother more then ordinary, not able to endure to ſee him vſed in this ſort, and not knowing how to take it, grew almoſt angry with me; whereat, I could not hold from ſmiling, and at laſt I told him:</p>

Be not grieued at this anſwer, <hi>Celadon:</hi> for we are ſtraitly tyed to it, ſince the ſhepheards of theſe times (for the moſt part) delight to make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one beleeue, that they haue better fortunes then indeede they haue, thinking that the glory of a ſhepheard ſhall be increaſed by the diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our honour. And, that you may know, that I know well the humour of <hi>Phillis,</hi> I tooke the charge vpon me, to bring <hi>Licidas</hi> into her good grace: prouided that he continue, and that he haue a little patience. But I muſt tell you, that when I firſt talked with her, ſhe put me off ſo farre, that I could but onely hope, ſo that I reſolued to winne her in time. But <hi>Licidas,</hi> who had no patience, had a purpoſe to loue her no more; and at that time he would ordinarily goe ſinging theſe verſes:</p>

ſhe, the ſhepheards of this countrey are ſuch diſſemblers, that often their heart denies that which their mouth promiſeth, that if without paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we looke into the actions of ſuch as hee, wee ſhall finde nothing but cunning.

                  <p>In the end (wiſe <hi>Diane)</hi> after many replies on both ſides, we ſo wrought, that <hi>Licidas</hi> was entertained; and from that time we began, all foure, one life, which was not vnpleaſing, either of vs fauouring the other, with the moſt diſcretion we could poſſibly. And that we might the better couer our deſſigne, we inuented many meanes, were it to talke, were it to write in ſecreſie.</p>
                  <p>It may be, you haue noted that little rocke, that ſtandeth vpon the great way, to the Rocke: you muſt needs know that it is painefull to get vp: but being there, the place is ſo fenced, that a man may be there vnſeene of any; and becauſe it ſtands on the hie way, wee made choice of it to meete in, that none might ſpy vs; and if any mette vs going by, wee made ſhew to be on our way, and that neither the one nor the other might go in vaine, we put in the morning ſome bough at the foote of it for a marke, that we had ſomewhat to ſay.</p>
                  <p>It is true that we were ſo neere vnto the high way; that our rayſed voyce might eaſily be heard of them that paſſed by: this was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cauſe that, vſually we left either <hi>Phillis</hi> or <hi>Licidas</hi> to watch, that at what time ſoeuer they ſawe any come afarre off, they ſhould cough to giue vs warning. And becauſe wee were vſed to write alwayes when we were letted or hindered, and could not come to that place, wee choſe out along that little riuer that runnes by the great way, an olde Willow tree halfe eaten for age; in the hollow whereof, we alwayes layd our let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and that we might more eaſily make anſwer, wee vſually left ſome paper and an inkehorne.</p>
                  <p>To be ſhort (wiſe <hi>Diane)</hi> we turned on euery ſide that wee poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could, to keepe vs from diſcouery: And namely, wee forthwith tooke this courſe, not to talke together, <hi>Celadon</hi> and I, nor <hi>Licidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis:</hi> ſo that there were many that thought that <hi>Celadon</hi> had changed his minde, becauſe that as ſoone as he ſaw <hi>Phillis,</hi> he would haſte to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine her, and ſhe ſhewed him all the good countenance ſhe could; and I likewiſe alwayes, when <hi>Licidas</hi> came in place, brake company from any other, to go talke with him. It fell out in ſucceſſe of time, that <hi>Celadon</hi>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:177519:57"/>
himſelfe was of opinion, that I loued <hi>Licidas;</hi> and I beleeued he loued <hi>Phillis:</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> thought <hi>Licidas</hi> loued me; and <hi>Licidas</hi> ſuſpected that <hi>Phillis</hi> loued <hi>Celadon,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that vnawares we found our ſelues ſo cumbred with theſe opinions, that iealouſie made vs know, that a little ſhewe will cauſe him breed in an heart that loueth well. Indeed (inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted <hi>Phillis)</hi> we were Louers and Schollers at that time: for, to what purpoſe ſerued it, to conceale that we truly loued, by making men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue a loue that was not, ſince you may as well feare, that men ſhould thinke you beare good will to <hi>Licidas,</hi> as to <hi>Celadon?</hi> Siſter, ſiſter, replyed <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> clapping her hand on her ſhoulder; we feare not when men doe thinke of vs that which is not; and on the contrary, the leaſt ſuſpition of that which is true, giues vs no reſt. Truly iealouſie (continued ſhe, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing toward <hi>Diane)</hi> ſo attached vs all foure, that I thinke that life had long laſted among vs, if ſome good ſpirit had not wrought in vs a cleer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the preſence each of other. Some ſeuen or eight dayes paſſed, that we ſawe not each other in the rocke, and that the letters which <hi>Celadon</hi> and I layd, were ſo differing from thoſe we formerly vſed, that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med they were differing perſons. At laſt, as I told you, ſome good ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit hauing care of vs, cauſed vs (by chance) to meete all foure in that place, without other company. And the loue of <hi>Celadon</hi> (therein more ſtrong then the reſt, in that it compelled him to ſpeake firſt) put theſe words into his mouth:</p>
                  <p>Faire <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> if I thought time could giue remedy to the paine I feele, I would referre my ſelfe to that which it might bring; but ſince the older it growes, the more it increaſeth, I am enforced to ſeeke out a better, by the complaint that I am to make to you of the wrong I receiue, and I am more readily brought to it, for that I am to make my complaint both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Iudges, and my aduerſaries. And as he was going forward, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> interrupted him, ſaying that he was in payne, that in greatneſſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered not from his. In greatneſſe (ſayd <hi>Celadon)</hi> it is impoſſible: for mine is extreme. And mine (replyed <hi>Licidas)</hi> is without compariſon. While the ſhepheards talked together, I turned to <hi>Phillis,</hi> and ſayd, You ſee (ſiſter) theſe ſhepheards will complaine of vs. Whereto ſhee anſwered me, But we haue more cauſe to complaine of them. But yet (ſayd I) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I haue great cauſe to complayne of <hi>Celadon,</hi> yet I haue more of you, who vnder the colour of the friendſhip you ſeeme to beare me, haue drawne him from that hee made ſhew of to me; ſo that I may ſay, you haue robbed me. And for that <hi>Phillis</hi> ſtood ſo confuſed at my words, that ſhe knew not what to anſwer, <hi>Celadon</hi> turning to me, ſaid: Ah faire ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe!
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:177519:57"/>
but fleeting as fayre: Is it ſo, that you haue loſt the memory of the ſeruices of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and of your owne othes? I complayne not ſo much of <hi>Licidas,</hi> though he haue fayled in his duty of proximity and amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, as of you to your ſelfe: knowing well, that the deſire which your perfections may bring into an heart, may make it forget all reſpect of duty. But is it poſſible, that ſo long a ſeruice as mine, ſo abſolute a power as you haue euer had ouer me, and ſo entire an affection as mine cannot ſomewhat ſtay the inconſtancy of your ſoule? or in good time, if yet all that commeth from me, be of ſo ſmall force, how comes it, that your fayth ſo often ſworne, and the gods ſo often called to witneſſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not with-hold you from making a new election before my face? At the ſame time <hi>Licidas</hi> taking the fayre hand of <hi>Phillis,</hi> after a great ſigh, hee ſayd: Faire hand, wherein I had entirely placed my will, can I liue, and know that thou delighteſt to be borne to another heart, then mine? then mine, I ſay, that haue merited ſo much of fortune, if a man may be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy by the moſt great, moſt ſincere, and by the moſt faithfull loue that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was.</p>
                  <p>I could not heare the other words that <hi>Licidas</hi> went on with; for I was conſtrained to anſwer <hi>Celadon.</hi> Shepheard, ſhepheard, ſaid I, all theſe words of faithfulneſſe, and of amity, are more in your mouth, then in your heart: and I haue more cauſe to complaine of you, then to heare you. But becauſe I make no more reckning of any thing that comes from you, I will not vouchſafe to complaine; ſo ſhould you doe, if your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulations would ſuffer you. But ſince our affayres be at theſe tearmes, go on, <hi>Celadon,</hi> loue <hi>Phillis</hi> well, ſerue her well, her vertues deſerue it: and if in ſpeaking vnto you, I bluſh, it is for ſpite that I haue loued that which was ſo vnworthy, and hath ſo groſſely deceiued me. The aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Celadon</hi> was ſo great, hearing the reproches I vſed to him, that he ſtayed a long time, not able to ſpeake a word: which gaue me oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to heare what <hi>Phillis</hi> anſwered <hi>Licidas. Licidas, Licidas,</hi> let him that ownes me, demaund me. You call me fleeting, and you know well, that that terme agrees beſt with your actions. But, thinke you in complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning firſt, you can purge the wrong you doe me? I falter not, but your ſelfe: for it is more ſhame to you to change, then it is loſſe to me in your change. But that which offends me, is, that you will accuſe me for your owne fault, and faine a good reaſon of your owne vnfaithfulneſſe. Yet it is true, that he that deceiueth a brother, may fayle her that is not ſo neere him. And then turning her ſelfe to mee, ſhe ſayd: And you, <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> thinke that the gayne you haue made by diuerting him from my amitie,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:177519:58"/>
can no longer laſt, then vntill ſome other obiect preſent it ſelfe; though I know well, your perfections haue that power, that if it be not an heart all of feathers, they are able to ſlay it. <hi>Phillis</hi> (replyed I) the proofe ſhall witneſſe, that you are a flatterer, when you ſpeake ſo of the perfections which are in me; ſince hauing depriued me of <hi>Celadon,</hi> they muſt needes be feeble, not being able to hold him, after they had gotten him. <hi>Celadon</hi> falling on his knee before me: It is not (ſaid he) that I miſprize the merits of <hi>Phillis:</hi> but I proteſt before all the gods, that ſhe hath not kindled the leaſt ſparke of loue in my ſoule; and that I beare with leſſe griefe, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence you doe me in changing, then that you commit againſt my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in blaming it of inconſtancy. It is to no purpoſe (wiſe <hi>Diane)</hi> to particularize all our diſcourſe; for they would be too long, and might offend you; ſo that before we parted, we were ſo well reduced to our good ſences, that I muſt tell you, we acknowledged the ſmall reaſon we had to ſuſpect one another. And we haue good cauſe to thanke heauen, that we made this declaration all foure together; for I thinke, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it had beene impoſſible to roote out this errour from our ſoule: and (for my owne part) I aſſure you, that nothing could haue made mee vnderſtand reaſon, if <hi>Celadon</hi> had not ſpoken after this manner before <hi>Phillis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſince that time, we went with leſſe heede then we were wont. But to leaue this trauaile, I enter into another no leſſe troubleſome: for we could not ſo well diſſemble, but <hi>Alcippe,</hi> that lay in watch, knew, that his ſonnes affection to mee was not altogether extinct; and for his more aſſurance, hee looked ſo heedfully to his actions, that noting with what curioſity he went alwaies to the old Willow, where we layd our letters; one morning he came firſt, and after he had long ſought, noting the path which wee had made on the graſſe, by often going, hee tooke it for his guide; and the tract brought him right to the foote of the tree, where he found a letter which I had layd there ouer-night: It was thus:</p>

                           <hi>YEſterday we went out of the temple, where we were aſſembled to bee preſent, at the houres which they did to</hi> Pan <hi>and</hi> Siringue, <hi>celebrating their day: I ſhould haue ſayd feaſting, if you had beene there: but the loue I bare you is ſuch, that not the diuine things (if it may be lawfull for me to ſay ſo) without you can pleaſe mee. I finde my ſelfe ſo vnfit, for our common buſineſſe, that but for the promiſe, which I made to write daily to you, I know not if this day you ſhould haue heard any newes from me.

When <hi>Alcippe</hi> had read this letter, he layd it in the ſame place againe and hiding himſelfe to ſee the anſwer: his ſonne was not ſlacke in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming; and not finding any paper, he writ on the backe of my Letter, and hath told me ſince, it was thus:</p>

But the offence is not ſmall, that you had not written at this time, but for that you promiſed me: For I am indebted to your promiſe, and not to your loue. Remember, I beſeech you, that I am not yours, becauſe I haue promiſed you, but becauſe I am truly yours; and that in like ſort I deſire not Letters for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions that are betweene vs, but for the ſole witneſſe of your goodwill, not wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comming them as merchandiſes, but as being ſent me from an entire good will.</hi>

                     <hi>Alcippe</hi> knew not who the ſhepheardeſſe might be, to whom this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was directed, for there was no name to it: but ſee how it came from a ſpirit that would be croſſe! he thought not much of his paine, to ſtay in that place aboue 5. or 6 houres, to ſee who ſhe ſhould be that would come to ſeeke it: aſſuring himſelfe, the day would not be fully paſt, but ſome one would come fetch it. It was late before I went: but preſently, when he ſawe me, for feare leſt I ſhould take him, he turned himſelfe, and made ſhew as if he were aſleepe. And I, that I might giue no cauſe of ſuſpition, turning my pace, fayned to take another way. He contrarily well ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for his payne, as ſoone as I was gone, tooke the Letter, and carried it with him. Whereupon incontinently hee made his deſſigne to ſend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his ſonne, for that he would not in any caſe, there ſhould be alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance betweene vs, for the extreme hatred betweene <hi>Aloe</hi> and him, but rather to the contrary, hee had a purpoſe to marry him vnto <hi>Malthe</hi> the daughter of <hi>Forelle,</hi> for commodity (as he pretended) of their neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. The words which were vſed betweene vs at our departing, haue beene but too much publiſhed by one of the Nymphes of <hi>Belinde.</hi> For I know not how that day <hi>Licidas,</hi> who was at the foot of the rocke, fell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſleepe; and that Nymph, as ſhe went by, heard vs, and wrote downe in her Tables all our diſcourſe. And what? (interrupted <hi>Diane)</hi> are thoſe the verſes which I haue heard ſung to one of my mothers Nymphes at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of a ſhepheard? Theſe be they, anſwered <hi>Astrea:</hi> and becauſe I would not diſcouer, that it any thing touched me, I durſt not demaund them.

                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:177519:59"/>
Now, during this abſence, <hi>Olympe,</hi> the daughter of ſhepheard <hi>Lupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> dwelling on the confines of <hi>Foreſt,</hi> on the ſide the riuer <hi>Furant,</hi> came with her mother into our Hamlet: and, becauſe this good olde woman much loued <hi>Amarillis,</hi> as hauing in their youth beene bred together, ſhee came to viſite her. This young ſhepheardeſſe was not ſo faire as ſhe was conceited, and had ſo good an opinion of her ſelfe, that ſhee thought all the ſhepheards that looked on her, were in loue with her; which is a rule infallible, for all thoſe that loue themſelues. That was the cauſe, that as ſoone as ſhe came into the houſe of <hi>Alcippe,</hi> that ſhee began to buſie her ſelfe with <hi>Licidas,</hi> thinking the ciuility hee vſed toward her, proceeded of Loue. As ſoone as the ſhepheard perceiued it, hee came to tell vs, and know how he ſhould behaue himſelfe: wee gaue aduiſe (that hee might the better couer the affection he bore to <hi>Phillis)</hi> to maintaine <hi>Olympe</hi> in this opinion. And ſhortly after, it fell out by miſchance, that <hi>Artemis</hi> had ſome affaires on the coaſt of <hi>Allier,</hi> whither ſhee carried <hi>Phillis</hi> with her, notwithſtanding all the cunning we could inuent to keepe her back. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring this abſence, which might bee about fiue or ſixe moneths, the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Olympe</hi> returned, leauing her daughter in the hands of <hi>Amarillis,</hi> with a purpoſe that <hi>Licidas</hi> ſhould marry her, iudging, according to that they ſaw, that he loued her very dearely. And becauſe it was an aduance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to her, ſhe was counſelled by her mother, to carry her ſelfe as loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as ſhe could. And aſſure you, faire <hi>Diane,</hi> ſhe diſſembled not, for thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth ſhe rather ſued vnto him, then was ſued vnto by him: So that one day, when ſhee found him at leaſure, as ſhee thought, within the inward parts of the wood of <hi>Bonlieu,</hi> where by fortune hee went to ſeeke a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring ſheep: after ſome common, ſpeeches ſhe laid her arme on his neck, and after ſhe had kiſſed him, ſayd, Gentle ſhepheard, I know not what I haue in mee ſo vnpleaſing, that I cannot by any demonſtrations of good will, finde place in your good graces. It may be, anſwered the ſhepheard ſmiling, becauſe I haue none. He that ſhould ſay as you doe, replied the ſhepheardeſſe, may be thought to be as much blinded as your ſelfe, if you ſee not the offer which I make of my amity; till when, ſhepheard, ordaine you that I loue without being beloued, and that I ſhal ſtill ſeek you, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out finding acceptance. I cannot thinke, that the other ſhepheardeſſes whom you make ſo much of, are more louely then my ſelfe, or haue any thing aboue me, but the poſſeſſion of your good graces. <hi>Olympe</hi> vttered theſe words with that affection, that <hi>Licidas</hi> was moued at it. Faire <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,</hi> at all other times, when I remember this accident that befell the ſhepheard, I could not refraine from laughter, but now my misfortune
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:177519:59"/>
forbids me, &amp; yet me thought I could be angry with none but <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had ſo charged him to loue her: for this fayning at laſt turned to earneſt.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon this miſerable <hi>Olympe,</hi> thinking by her fauours to make her ſelfe beloued the more, made her ſelfe to be ſo much diſ-eſteemed, that <hi>Licidas</hi> hauing had of her all that he might, diſdained her ſo, that he could not abide ſhe ſhould be neere him. Preſently after this fortune befell, hee came to tell me with ſuch apparance of diſpleaſure, that (I thinke) hee was ſorry for his fault; and yet it fell not out ſo: for this ſhepheardeſſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch folly, that ſhee grew to bee with childe; and about the time ſhee firſt perceiued it, <hi>Phillis</hi> returned from her iourney: and if I expected her with great paine, I likewiſe welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>med her with much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment. But as commonly they firſt dema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of that which neereſt toucheth the hart, <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> after two or three former words, failed not to aske how <hi>Licidas</hi> did, &amp; how he behaued himſelfe with <hi>Olympe.</hi> Very well (anſwered I) and I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure my ſelfe, hee will not bee long before hee come to tell you newes. I cut my ſpeech the ſhorter, for feare I might tell her ſomewhat that might anger <hi>Licidas,</hi> who for his part was not without paine, not knowing how to aboord the ſhepherdeſſe: at laſt he reſolued to ſuffer al things rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to bee baniſhed from her ſight, and came to finde her in her lodging, where he knew I was. As ſoone as ſhee ſaw him, ſhee ran to him with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen armes to ſalute him: but giuing a little backe, he ſayd, Faire <hi>Phillis,</hi> I haue not hardines enough to come neere you, except you pardon me the fault I haue done you. The ſhepherdeſſe thinking he had excuſed himſelfe for comming no ſooner, as hee was accuſtomed, (anſwered him) There is nothing can hold me backe from ſaluting <hi>Licidas;</hi> and when he hath offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded mee, I muſt pardon him alwaies. At this word ſhee came forward, &amp; welcommed him with great affection, but it was his pleaſure when hee brought her backe to me, to pray me tell his errour to his Miſtris, that hee might ſpeedily know to what ſhe would condemne him. Not for that the griefe (ſaith he) ſhall not accompany me to my graue, but for the deſire I haue to know what you ordaine of me. This word brought colour into the face of <hi>Phillis,</hi> doubting that her pardon was greater then her mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: whereof <hi>Licidas</hi> taking heed, I haue not courage enough ſaid he to me, to heare the declaration you ſhall make of me. Pardon me then, faire Miſtris (turning to <hi>Phillis)</hi> if I break company ſo ſoon, &amp; if my life be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to you, and that my death may giue you ſatisfaction, be not coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous of my bloud. At this word though <hi>Phillis</hi> called him back, yet would he not come, but contrarily pulling the doore after him, left vs alone. You may not thinke that <hi>Phillis</hi> made dainty, to aske if there were any
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:177519:60"/>
newes, &amp; whence ſo great feare came. Without ſtay in lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g diſcourſe, I told her as it was, and withall, laid al the fault on our ſelues, who did not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, that his youth could no longer reſiſt the aſſaults of this folly, and that his diſpleaſure was ſo great, that his error was pardonable. At the firſt I could not obtaine that I deſired of her; but ſome few dayes after, <hi>Licidas,</hi> by my counſell, came to caſt himſelfe on his knees, and ſhe ranne into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other chamber that ſhe might not ſee him, and from thence into another, flying from <hi>Licidas,</hi> who ſtill followed her, and was reſolued, as hee ſaid, not to let her reſt, till he had either pardon or death. In the end, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whither to fly further, ſhe ſtayed in a cloſet; where <hi>Licidas</hi> entring, and ſhutting the dores, he ſet himſelfe on his knees before her, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking any other thing, attended the ſentence of her will. This af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate obſtinacy had more force in her, then any perſwaſions; and ſo ſtaying ſome while without ſpeaking to him,</p>
                  <p>Goe, ſayd ſhe to him importunate, it is thy importunity, and not the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e that I pardon. At this word hee kiſſed her hand, and came to open mee the doore, to giue me to vnderſtand, that he had got the victory; and then ſeeing his affaires in ſo good caſe, I would not let them part aſunder, vntil all actions were intirely forgiuen: and <hi>Phillis</hi> ſo pardoned the ſhepheard, that ſeeing him diſtreſſed extremely, to hide <hi>Olympes</hi> belly, which now grew great to the view, ſhe offered to aſſiſt him in all that poſſibly ſhee could. Certainely (interrupted <hi>Diane)</hi> ſee a ſtrange proofe of good amity, to pardon ſuch an offence which is intirely againſt amity: and more, to prouide that ſhe which cauſed it, take no diſpleaſure. Without fayning, <hi>Phillis,</hi> this is too much; and for mee, I proteſt, my courage knowes not how to brooke it: yet my amity did ſo then, anſwered <hi>Phillis,</hi> and by that you may iudge of what quality it was in me. Let vs leaue this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration apart (replyed <hi>Diane)</hi> for it would be too hard for you, ſince the not feeling the offences which be done againſt amity, is rather a ſigne of defect, then the ouer-abundance of Loue: and for my part, if I had beene one of the friends of <hi>Licidas,</hi> I ſhould haue interpreted rather to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduantage of your good will. Ah! <hi>Diane,</hi> ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> if you as well knew what it is to loue, as you doe to cauſe your ſelfe to bee beloued, you will iudge it needfull the friend ſhould know himſelfe, but heauen is pleaſed to haue you be beloued, and not to loue. If it be ſo, ſayd <hi>Diane,</hi> I am more bound to it for ſuch a benefit, then for my life; but I may be capable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out louing, to iudge of Loue. It cannot be, interrupted <hi>Phillis.</hi> I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hold my peace, anſwered <hi>Diane,</hi> then ſpeak with ſo deare a permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but if you will allow me the fauour that you giue to the Phyſician, who
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:177519:60"/>
talkes and iudges indifferently of all ſorts of diſeaſes, though he neuer had them: I would tell you, that if there be any thing in amity whereof wee may make reckoning, it ought to be the amity it ſelfe without more; for all other things that pleaſe vs, are but to be ioyned with it: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is nothing that more offends him that loues, then to ſpie any defect in loue: and not to feele ſuch offences, is (indeed) to haue a ſpirit feeble for that paſſion. And will you haue mee tell you what I thinke of Loue? It is a muſike of many voyces, that well concording, giues a right ſweet harmony; but if there be but one diſcord, it not onely diſpleaſes, but makes you forget all the pleaſure which they yeelded before. So ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> Naughty <hi>Diane,</hi> you would ſay, that if a man haue ſerued you long, the firſt offence muſt blot out all the memory of that is paſſed. The very ſame ſaid <hi>Diane,</hi> or little leſſe. O gods, cryed <hi>Phillis!</hi> ſhall not hee that loues you, haue worke enough? He that loues me (replyed <hi>Diane)</hi> if he wil that I loue him, muſt beware he offend not my loue. And beleeue me <hi>(Phillis)</hi> that at this bout, you haue done more iniury to <hi>Licidas</hi> then, when he offended you before. Then ſayd <hi>Phillis</hi> ſmiling, At another time I will ſay, that it is Loue that made me do it; but at this time I will ſay, it is Reuenge: and to the moſt curious, I will deliuer the reaſon which you haue taught me. They will iudge (replyed <hi>Diane)</hi> that at another time you know to loue; but at this time you know what it is to loue. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it be (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> if it be of defect, it proceedes of ignorance, and not of want of loue. For I thinke I am bound: but if euer he returne, I will look to my ſelfe for falling backe againe. And you, <hi>Astrea,</hi> are ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long ſilent: then tell vs what aſſiſtance I gaue for the birth of this childe. Then <hi>Astrea</hi> tooke it vp againe in this ſort.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as this ſhepheardeſſe had made this offer of her ſelfe, <hi>Licidas</hi> accepted of it very boldly; and after that ſent a yong ſhepheard to <hi>Maine</hi> to bring with him, the wiſe woman of that place; her eyes being cloſed, that ſhe ſhould not diſcerne which way ſhe went. Then <hi>Diane</hi> as aſtoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, laid her finger on her mouth, and ſaies, Faire ſhepheardeſſe, this is not ſo ſecret as you thinke: I remember I haue heard them ſpeake of it. I pray you, ſaid <hi>Phillis,</hi> tell vs what you haue heard, that we may know whether it hath bene told you true; I know not, added <hi>Diane,</hi> if I well remember the poore <hi>Philander</hi> was he that told it me, and I aſſure my ſelfe he had it from <hi>Lucina</hi> the wiſe woman, to whoſe eare it came; and that ſhee would neuer haue ſpoken of it, if any truſt had bene repoſed in her. One day as ſhe walked into the Parke which is betweene <hi>Mont-briſon</hi> and <hi>Maine,</hi> with many other her companions, ſhee ſaw come towards her a man
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:177519:61"/>
whom ſhe did not know: who at his comming, did commendations from diuers of her kinſ-folks that were at <hi>Feurs,</hi> and then he told her ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, that hee might ſeparate her a little from the other women which were with her: &amp; when he ſaw her alone, he gaue her to vnderſtand, that a better occaſion had brought him to her; for it is (ſaid he) to coniure you by all the pitty you euer had, to giue your helping hand to an honeſt woman, that is in danger if you deny your aide. The good woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was a little ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to heare him change his diſcourſe at once: but the yong man beſought her to hide her aſtoniſhment as well as ſhe could; &amp; that he had rather dye, then any ſhould ſuſpect this buſineſſe: <hi>Lucina</hi> being aſſured, and hauing promiſed to be ſecret, and that he ſhould only tell her at what time ſhee ſhould be ready: You muſt make no iourney for theſe two months, ſayd the yong man; and that you may not loſe by it, behold here the money which you might gaine elſewhere in that ſpace. At that word hee gaue her ſome pieces of gold in a paper, and returned without paſſing thorow the towne: but after he had knowne of her, whether ſhe could trauaile by night, and ſhe anſwered, ſeeing the gaine ſo great, No time could ſtay her: within fifteene or ſixteene dayes after, as ſhee went out of <hi>Maine,</hi> about fiue or ſix of the clock at night, ſhe ſaw him come with a viſage alcha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged: and comming neere her, he ſayd, Mother, the time hath deceiued vs, wee muſt be gone, the horſes tarry for vs, and neceſſity preſſes vs. She would haue gone back to her houſe, to giue ſome order to her buſineſſes: but hee would not ſuffer her, fearing ſhee ſhould ſpeake to ſome-body. So being come into a valley farre from the high way, ſhe found two horſes with a man of ſome ſort, and clothed in blacke, that held them. As ſoone as he ſaw <hi>Lucina,</hi> he came to her with open face; and after many thankes, hee cauſed her to ſit vp behind him that went to fetch her; after, mounting on the other horſe, they rode a rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d trot ouerthwart the field; and when they were ſome diſtance from the towne, and that the night began to draw darke, this yong man taking an handkercher out of his pocket, bound it about the eyes of <hi>Lucina,</hi> for all the reſiſtance ſhee could make; and after they had twice or thrice turned about the horſe whereon ſhe rode, that ſhe might haue no knowledge of the Way, which they meant to take; and then falling againe to their trot, rode a great part of the night, ſhee not knowing which way ſhee went, but that they made her paſſe a riuer (as ſhe thought) t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> or thrice, and then ſetting her on the ground, made her walke a while on her feet; and as ſhee could iudge, it was thorow a wood, where at laſt ſhe ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>d a little light a-croſſe the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dkercher, which within a while after they tooke cleane away. And then ſhe found her ſelfe vnder
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:177519:61"/>
a tent of tapiſtry, fitted in ſuch ſort, that the wind might not enter: on the one ſide ſhe ſaw a yong woman in a field bed, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained much, &amp; was maſked, at the beds feete ſhee perceiued a woman who had likewiſe her face couered, and who by her habit ſeemed to bee aged, ſhee held there hands ioyned together, and had teares in her eyes: on the other ſide there was a yong maide of the chamber masked, with a light in her hand at the beds head ſtood leaning that honeſt man whom ſhe found with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, who ſeemed infinitly to feele the griefe of this woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vpon her ſtomake; and the yong man which brought her behind him, went about to giue that which was neceſſary, there being on the table in the midſt of the tent two great candles lighted. It may eaſily be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that <hi>Lucina</hi> was aſtoniſhed to ſee her ſelfe in this place; but ſhe had not leiſure to be long ſo: for one may iudge, that this little creature wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but for the comming of this woman to come into the world. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt the throwes of her down lying, which laſted but halfe an houre, before the deliuery of a daughter: but this was a diligence yet greater then ordinary, to deliuer her, and lay her in bed, and put the childe into a cradle, and ſend away <hi>Lucina,</hi> after they had well contented her, yet her eyes againe cloſed as ſhe came. Now if they had truſted her, ſhe ſwore ſhe would neuer haue ſpoken of it, but ſhee thought their miſtruſt gaue her leaue; and now you ſee all that I could know of <hi>Philander. Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> who had bene attentiue to her diſcourſe, looked one on the other much aſtoniſhed, &amp; <hi>Phillis</hi> could not chuſe but laugh; and <hi>Diane</hi> deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reaſon: It is, ſayd ſhee, becauſe you haue told vs a ſtory which we neuer knew, and for my part I cannot imagine how it may be: for, for <hi>Olympe,</hi> ſhe was neuer in that danger; &amp; of neceſſity it muſt be ſome other then a ſhepheardeſſe that had ſo good furniture. Indeed (anſwered <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne)</hi> I take this honeſt man for <hi>Licidas,</hi> the old woman for the mother of <hi>Celadon,</hi> and the chamber-maid for you; and iudge you whether you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed not your ſelues, that you might not be knowne. I aſſure you, ſayd <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that this was not <hi>Olympe:</hi> for <hi>Phillis</hi> vſed no other arte, but to cauſe her come to her houſe, and by chance her mother <hi>Artemis</hi> was then gone to the riuer of <hi>Alli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>r;</hi> and becauſe <hi>Olympe</hi> was vnder the hands of <hi>Amarillis,</hi> of neceſſity ſhe muſt faine to bee ſicke, which was eaſy for her to do, by reaſon of the diſeaſe ſhe went with; and after ſhe had ſpent ſome time, ſhe told the mother of <hi>Celado<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that the change of the aire might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring ſome aſſwagement, and that ſhe was certaine that <hi>Phillis</hi> would be well pleaſed to haue her neere her. <hi>Amarillis,</hi> that thought ſhe ſhould bee charged with her ſickeneſſe, was well contented with this reſolution;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:177519:62"/>
and ſo <hi>Phillis</hi> came to fetch her. And when the terme approched, <hi>Licidas</hi> went to bring the wiſe woman, and blinde her eyes that ſhee might not know the way: but when ſhee was come, he vnbound her, knowing well that ſhee knew not <hi>Olympe,</hi> as hauing neuer ſeene her before. Thus you ſee all the art that was vſed: and as ſoone as ſhee was well deliuered, ſhe went home, and they haue told vs ſince, that ſhe vſed a pretty tricke to bring vp the childe; for, as ſoone as ſhee came thither, ſhe ſuborned a ſimple woman, that fained to haue borne it, to come to father it vpon a ſhepheard, who vſed to waite on her mother, ſaying that ſhee had it by him. And for that this poore ſhepheard knew himſelfe innocent, her refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and reuiled her; ſo that ſhe that was prepared for the purpoſe, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to the chamber of <hi>Lupander;</hi> and there, though the ſhepheard refuſed it, yet ſhe left the infant in the middeſt of the chamber, and went her way. They told vs, <hi>Lupander</hi> was very angry: but the concluſion was, that <hi>Olympe</hi> turning to her mother: Muſt it be ſo (ſayd ſhe) that this little creature ſhould ſtay without nouriſhment? It cannot help anothers fault, and it ſhall be a worke pleaſing the gods, to bring it vp. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was good and charitable, agreed; and ſo <hi>Olympe</hi> brought vp her childe at home. In this meane time <hi>Celadon</hi> was with <hi>Forelle,</hi> where they gaue him all the good entertainment they might; and eſpecially <hi>Malthe</hi> had commaundement from her father, to doe him all the honeſt kindneſſes ſhe could: but <hi>Celadon</hi> was ſo diſcontented with our ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that all their honeſt reſpects were in place of puniſhment to him, and he went about with ſuch a ſadneſſe, that <hi>Forelle</hi> not beeing able to brooke the contempt he had of his daughter, aduertiſed <hi>Alcippe</hi> of it, to the end he might no longer expect this alliance, who knowing the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his ſonne, moued (as I thinke) out of pitty, purpoſed once more to vſe ſome piece of cunning, and thenceforth neuer to torment him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more. During the abode that <hi>Celadon</hi> made with <hi>Malthe,</hi> my vnkle <hi>Phocion</hi> ſo wrought, that <hi>Corebe</hi> a very rich and honeſt ſhepheard, became a ſuiter to me; and becauſe hee had all the good parts that one might wiſh, many men talked of it, as if the marriage had beene reſolued on. Whereupon <hi>Alcippe</hi> meaning to make vſe of it, deuiſed this crafty tricke I tell you:</p>
                  <p>There was a ſhepheard named <hi>Squilinder,</hi> dwelling on the bounds of the <hi>Forreſt,</hi> in an Hamlet called <hi>Argental,</hi> a cunning fellow, and vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and who among his other induſtries, knew ſo well to counterfet all kinde of Letters, that the man whom he initated, can hardly diſcerne the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falſhood. To him <hi>Alcippe</hi> ſhewes what he found at the foote of the tree,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:177519:62"/>
as I haue told you before, and cauſes him to write another to <hi>Celadon</hi> (in my name) which was thus:</p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>

                        <p>CEladon, <hi>ſince I am compelled by my fathers commaundement, you may not thinke it ſtrange, that I pray you to end this loue which heeretofore I haue coniured you to hold eternall.</hi> Alce <hi>hath giuen me to</hi> Corebe; <hi>and though the match be to my aduauncement, yet can I not leaue to feele ſenſibly the ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our amity. Yet, ſince it is folly to contrary that which muſt not fall out o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I counſell you to arme your ſelfe with reſolution, and ſo to forget all that is paſſed betweene vs, that</hi> Celadon <hi>haue no more memory of</hi> Aſtrea, <hi>as</hi> Aſtrea <hi>is conſtrayned, from henceforth, to loſe (for dueties ſake) all the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of</hi> Celadon.</p>

                  </floatingText>
                  <p>This Le<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tter was brought ſo ſinely to <hi>Celadon,</hi> by a young ſhepheard vnknowne. O God! what was he at the encounter, and how great was the diſpleaſure that cut his heart? Then ſayd hee by <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> It is true that there is nothing of dura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in the world, ſince that firme reſolution which you haue ſo often ſworne, is ſo readily changed. Now you will make me be a witneſſe, that what perfection ſoeuer a woman may haue, ſhe can not bereaue her ſelfe of her inconſtancie by nature. Haue then the heauens agreed, that for my greater puniſhment, my life ſhould remaine after the loſſe of your amity, to the end that I ſhould onely liue more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely to feele my diſaſtor? And then falling into a ſwowne, he came no ſooner to himſelfe, but the complaints were in his mouth. And that which moſt eaſily perſwaded him of this change, was this, that the Letter did but confirme the common report of the marriage betweene <hi>Corebe,</hi> and me. He lay all that day on a bed, vnwilling to ſpeake to any perſon; and the night being come, he depriued himſelfe of his companions: he tooke to the largeſt and deſolateſt wood, ſhunning the meeting of men, more like a ſauge beaſt, deſiring to die farre from the ſociety and companie of men, ſince they were the cauſe of his ſorrow. In this reſolution hee ranne thorow all the mountaines of <hi>Foreſte,</hi> on the ſide of <hi>Ceruieres,</hi> where at the laſt he choſe a place which he thought leaſt frequented, of purpoſe to finish the reſt of his ſad and mournefull dayes there. The place is called <hi>Lapau,</hi> where riſeth one of the ſprings of the diſaſtrous riuer <hi>Lignon;</hi> for the other ſpring proceedeth from the mountaynes of <hi>Cholmeſel.</hi>

Now on the ſides of this fountaine he built a prety Lodge, where he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued retired more then ſixe moneths, during which time, his ordinary nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment were teares and plaints. It was at that time that hee made this ſong.</p>

                  <p>The ſolitarineſſe of <hi>Celadon</hi> had beene much longer, but for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement that <hi>Alcippe</hi> gaue to <hi>Licidas,</hi> to ſeeke out his brother, hauing a purpoſe in himſelfe (ſince he ſo well ſaw how vnprofitable his trauaile was) no more to croſſe this amity. Now <hi>Licidas</hi> had long ſought him, but for a chance that befell vs the ſame day.</p>
                  <p>I was vpon the banks of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and held mine eies ouer his ſtreame, thinking at that time of the loſſe of <hi>Celadon;</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Licidas</hi> tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked together ſome good while, when we ſaw ſome little balles, that lay ſwimming on the water. The firſt that tooke heed to it, was <hi>Phillis,</hi> who ſhewed it to vs, but we could not gheſſe what it might bee. And becauſe <hi>Licidas</hi> knew the curioſity of his miſtriſſe, to giue her ſatisfaction, he went as far as he could into the water, and ſo reached with a long branch, that he tooke one; but ſeeing that it was but waxe, becauſe hee was wet, and angry that he tooke ſuch paine for a thing of ſo ſmall worth, hee caſt it in a rage againſt the ground, and breaking it vpon a great flint ſtone, it fell
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:177519:64"/>
all in pieces, and there remained nothing but a paper, which had beene put therein, which <hi>Phillis</hi> ranne preſently to take vp; and hauing opened it, we read theſe words:</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Goe, paper, more happy then him that ſends thee, to ſee theſe ſhores ſo much beloued, where my ſhepheardeſſe dwels: and if accompanied with teares, wherewith I make this Riuer to ſwell, it chances thee to kiſſe the ſands where her ſteps are imprinted, ſtay thy courſe, and abide with good fortune, where my miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hap denies me to be. If thou happen to come to her hands, which haue taken from me my heart, and ſhe demand of thee, how I doe, tell her, O faithfull paper, that day and night I turne my ſelfe into teares, to waſh away her vnfaithfulneſſe: and if touched with repentance, ſhe wet thee with ſome teares, tell her, that by vnben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the bow, ſhe can neuer heale the wound which ſhe hath made in her faith &amp; my Loue and that my griefes are witneſſes, both before men and gods, that as ſhe is the most faire, and the moſt vnfaithfull in the world, ſo I am the most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and moſt affectionate that liues; with aſſurance, notwithstanding, neuer to haue contentment but in my death.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>We no ſooner caſt our eyes on this writing, but we knew it all three to be from <hi>Celadon,</hi> which was the cauſe that <hi>Licidas</hi> ran to draw out the others which floated on the water, but the ſtreame had carried them ſo farre, that hee could not come by them; yet we gheſſed thereby, that hee abode about the head of the <hi>Lignon;</hi> which cauſed <hi>Licidas</hi> in the morning to goe ſeeke him luckily, and vſed ſuch diligence, that three dayes after he found him in ſolitarineſſe, ſo changed from that that he was wont, that he might ſcarce know him: but when hee told him that he muſt come to me, and that I ſo commanded him, he could hardly be perſwaded, but that his brother came to deceiue him. At laſt, the letter which hee brought from me, gaue him ſuch contentment, that within few dayes hee came to his former countenance, and came to finde vs out: yet not ſo ſoone, but that <hi>Alcippe</hi> dyed before his returne; and ſome few dayes after <hi>Amarillis</hi> followed him. And then wee were of opinion, that fortune had done her worſt againſt vs, ſince theſe two were dead that contraried vs moſt. But it fell not out ſo, by the miſchiefe that the ſuite of <hi>Corebe</hi> went on ſo, that <hi>Alce, Hippolite,</hi> and <hi>Phocion</hi> would giue mee no reſt; and yet it was not from them that our miſchiefe came, though <hi>Corebe</hi> were in part a cauſe: for when hee came to make ſuite to mee, becauſe hee was very rich, hee brought with him many ſhepheards, among whom was <hi>Semire,</hi> a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard indeede repleate with good qualities, if he had not beene the moſt
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:177519:64"/>
pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rfidious and ſubtill fellow that euer was. As ſoone as hee caſt his eye on me, he had a purpoſe to ſerue me, forgetting the friendſhip that <hi>Corebe</hi> bare him. And becauſe <hi>Celadon</hi> and I, to cloke our amity, had layd a plot, as I told you, to diſſemble; he, to make loue to al the ſhepheardeſſes, and I, to ſuffer indifferently the wooing of all ſorts of ſhepheards: hee thought at firſt, that the good acceptance that I gaue him, was the bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of ſome greater affection; and he had not ſo ſoone knowne what was betweene <hi>Celadon</hi> and me, if (by miſchance) he had not found my letters: For though, to his laſt loſſe, it was well knowne hee loued mee, yet there were few that thought I loued him, I carried my ſelfe ſo coldly ſince <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladons</hi> laſt returne. And becauſe the letters which <hi>Alcippe</hi> had found at the foote of the tree, coſt vs deare, wee would no more rely on thoſe we wrote our ſelues, but inuented a new trick which wee thought more aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. <hi>Celadon</hi> had faſtened to a corner of his hat, on the inſide, a little piece of felt, ſo cunningly, that he could hardly ſee it, and this was locked with a button on the out-ſide, where he fayned to bind vp the brimme of his hat: in that he put his letter, and making ſhew to play, either he caſt me his hat, or I tooke it from him, or he let it lye; or fayning to runne or leap better, caſt it on the ground, and ſo I tooke and returned the letter. I know not by what misfortune, one day, when I had one in my hand to giue him, running after a Wolfe which came neere my flocks, I let it fall, vnhappily for me, which <hi>Semire,</hi> that came after, took vp, and ſaw it was thus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                           <hi>DEare</hi> Celadon, <hi>I haue receiued your letter, which was as welcome to me, as I know mine are to you, and I finde nothing that doth not ſatisfie me, except the thankes you giue, which (me thinkes) is to no purpoſe, neither for my loue, nor for</hi> Celadon, <hi>who of long time is wholly giuen mine. For, if they be not yours, know you not, that whatſoeuer wanteth, that title can neuer pleaſe mee? And if they be yours, why do you giue me ſeparated that, which at once I haue receiued, when you gaue your ſelfe to me?

                  <p>After he had found this letter, he purpoſed to ſpeake to me no more of Loue, vntill he had done ſome euill to <hi>Celadon,</hi> and began in this ſort. In the firſt place, hee beſought me to pardon him for being ſo raſh, that hee durſt raiſe his eyes on me, which my beauty compelled him to doe, but he
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:177519:65"/>
well knew his ſmal merit, and therefore he proteſted to me, neuer to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more, onely he deſired me to forget his boldneſſe. And after that, he made himſelfe ſo great a friend &amp; familiar to <hi>Celadon,</hi> that it ſeemed there was nothing which hee loued more; and to abuſe mee the more, hee neuer met me, without finding ſome occaſion to ſpeake to the aduantage of my ſhepheard, couering his intent ſo cunningly, that no man would thinke, that he had any ſuch deſigne.</p>
                  <p>Theſe praiſes of the perſon whom I loued, as I told you, deceiued me ſo, that I took extreme pleaſure to entertaine him, and ſo two or three mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths paſſed right happily for <hi>Celadon</hi> and me: but this was (as I beleeue) the more to make me feel that, which ſince I ceaſe not, nor euer ſhall ceaſe to bewaile. At this word, in place of ſpeech, her tears repreſented her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures to her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions with ſuch abundance, that neither the one nor the other durſt open their mouth, fearing to increaſe her ſorrow: for the more you labor by Reaſon, to dry the teares, the more they increaſe their ſprings. At laſt ſhe began again thus: Alas, wiſe <hi>Diane,</hi> how can I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this accident &amp; not die? From that time <hi>Semire</hi> was ſo familiar, both with <hi>Celadon</hi> and me, that for the moſt part, we were together. And when hee thought hee had gotten ſufficient credit with mee, to perſwade that which he meant to vndertake: One day, when he found me alone, after we had long talked of diuers treaſons that the ſhepherds did to the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes, whom they made ſhew to loue: But I wonder much, ſaid he, that there bee ſo fewe ſhepheardeſſes that take heede to their deceits, though otherwiſe they be very circumſpect. That is, anſwered I, for that Loue hath ſhut vp their eyes. Without fayning, replyed he, I beleeue ſo; for otherwiſe it were not poſſible, but you ſhould know what they would doe to you: and then holding his peace, he ſeemed to prepare himſelfe to ſay more, but as if he repented that he had told me ſo much, he beganne againe in this ſort: <hi>Semire, Semire,</hi> what thinkeſt thou to doe? Seeſt thou not that ſhee delights in thy deceit? Why wilt thou trouble thy ſelfe?</p>
                  <p>And then addreſſing himſelfe to me, he went on: I ſee well (faire <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea)</hi> that my diſcourſe hath brought you ſome diſpleaſure. But par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me, for that I haue bin compelled to it by the affection which I haue to your ſeruice. <hi>Semire</hi> (ſayd I) I am bound to you for this good will; but I ſhall be much more, if you finiſh that which you haue begunne. Ah ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid he) I haue told you too much; but, it may be, you ſhall (in time) know more of it, and then you ſhall judge, that (indeed) <hi>Semire</hi> is your ſeruant. Ah moſt malicious! how true hee ſeemed in his wicked promiſes! for I haue ſince knowne but too much; to leaue in mee onely
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:177519:65"/>
the deſire to liue. So it was, that at that time he would tell me no more, to make me the more deſirous; and he thought it was time, one day when (according to cuſtome) I preſſed him to let me know the end of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment: and I coniured him by the power which I had ſometimes ouer him, to tell me all that which he had begunne. He anſwered, Faire ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe, you ſo coniure me, that I hold it a great fault to diſobey you: I would I had neuer begunne that diſcourſe, which I foreſee the end will bring you. And after I had aſſured him of the contrary, he had the skill ſo well to perſwade me, that <hi>Celadon</hi> loued <hi>Aminthe</hi> the daughter of the ſonne of <hi>Cleante;</hi> that Iealouſie the ordinary companion of ſoules which loue dearely, beganne to perſwade me, that it might be true: and this was a miſchiefe extreme, that then I remembred not the commandement which I gaue him, to make ſhew of louing other ſhepheardeſſes. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, deſirous to make an end, to diſſemble my diſpleaſure, I anſwered <hi>Semire,</hi> that I did neuer beleeue, nor would, that <hi>Celadon</hi> made particular choice of me before others; that if it ſeemed we vſed any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity, it was but by reaſon of the long acquaintance which we haue had together; but as for his loue-ſuites, they were indifferent. Now anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the crafty companion, I thanke God your humour is ſuch: but ſince it is ſo, you cannot chooſe but take pleaſure to heare the paſſionate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which he had to his <hi>Aminthe.</hi> I proteſt to you (wiſe <hi>Diane)</hi> when I heard him name his <hi>Aminthe,</hi> I changed colour; and becauſe he offred me to heare their words, me thought I was not to ſhunne the knowledge of the perfidiouſneſſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> alas, more faithfull then I well aduiſed: and ſo I tooke his offer, and indeede hee fayled not in his promiſe. For, within a while after, he came running to me; and aſſuring mee, that hee left them cloſe together, and that <hi>Celadon</hi> layd his head in <hi>Aminthes</hi> lap, who ſate and rubbed his head, telling me the particulars, the more to torment me: I followed him ſo beſides my ſelfe, that I remember neither the way I went, nor how neere he brought me to them; yet they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me not, becauſe, as I haue iudged ſince, they cared not who heard, and therfore regarded not who hearkened. So it was, I found my ſelfe ſo neere, that I could heare <hi>Celadon</hi> ſay, Beleeue me (fayre ſhepheardeſſe) there is no beauty can be more liuely printed in a ſoule, then that which is in mine.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Celadon</hi> (anſwerd <hi>Aminthe)</hi> how is it poſſible that an heart ſtirring as yours, can haue the hardineſſe, to hold long that which loue can graue? Naughty ſhepheardeſſe (replyed my <hi>Celadon)</hi> let theſe reaſons goe by, meaſure not me by your wand, nor weights of any other; honor me with your good graces, and you ſhall ſee if I will not preſerue them as well in
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:177519:66"/>
my ſoule, and as long as my life. <hi>Celadon, Celadon,</hi> (replyed <hi>Aminthe)</hi> you ſhall be wel puniſhed, if your ieſt turne to earneſt, and if the heauens (in my reuenge) make you loue this <hi>Aminthe,</hi> whom you now ſport your ſelfe with. Hitherto there was nothing, but in ſome ſort it might be bom. But O God! to faine what was the anſwer he gaue. I pray Loue, ſayd he, (faire ſhepheard) if I mocke, that he cauſe the mockery to light on mee; if I haue deſerued any grace from him, that he inflict on mee the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment you threaten. <hi>Aminthe</hi> not able to iudge his intent by this diſcourſe, anſwered him not but with a ſmile, and with a caſting of her hand ouer her eyes, which I interpreted in my language, that ſhe refuſed not, but that ſhe beleeued his words for true: But that which touched me moſt to the quicke, was, that <hi>Celadon,</hi> after he had beene ſome-while without ſpeech, fetcht a deepe ſigh, which ſhe accompanyed preſently with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And when the ſhepheard roſe vp to ſpeake to her, ſhe layd her hand ouer her eies, &amp; waxed red, as halfe aſhamed, that this ſigh had ſo eſcaped her: which was the cauſe that <hi>Celadon</hi> lying downe in his former place, a little after ſung theſe verſes:</p>

And becauſe it was very late, I draue my ſheepe into their folds, and paſſed a night, ſuch as you may imagine: Alas! all this had beene nothing, if I had not ioyned thereto the folly, which I ſhall bewaile as long as I haue teares, neither know I who inueigled me: for if I had had any iudgement remaining in me, for this new iealouſie, at the leaſt, I might haue inquired of <hi>Celadon,</hi> what his purpoſe was, &amp; thogh he would haue diſſembled it, I ſhuld eaſily enough haue found out his fictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But without other conſideration, the next morning, when hee came to looke me at my flock, I talked to him with ſuch diſdaine, that deſperately he caſt himſelfe into that gulph, where drowning himſelfe, he hath at one blow drowned all my contentment. At this word ſhe grew pale like death; and had it not beene for <hi>Phillis,</hi> who rayſed her vp, pulling her by the arme, ſhee had beene in danger of ſwouning.</p>

He anſwered, The company which you ſo cheriſh, will not ſuffer you to hold that name. She (replyed the ſhepheardeſſe) of whom you complaine, ſuffereth more paine for offending you, then your ſelfe doe. That is (ſaid the ſhepheard) but to breake the weapon, rather then heale the wound. By this time <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrea</hi> came, &amp; addreſſing her ſelfe to <hi>Licidas,</hi> ſaid thus: I am ſo farre (ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) from ſaying, that the hatred you beare me, is vniuſt, that I auerre, you know not how to hate me ſo deadly, as you haue occaſion.

As ſhe lay entertaining her thoughts, and as ſhe was heedfully hearkening, ſhe heard one talke ſomewhat neere her: for there was but a ſlight partition that diuided one chamber into two, for that the Maſter of the houſe was an honeſt ſhepherd, that out of courteſie &amp; the lawes of hoſpitality, freely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained al paſſingers, without enquiring what they were, and becauſe his lodging was ſcant, he was faine to make that diuiſion, to make the more chambers. Now when the Nymph came thither, there were two ſtangers lodged, but becauſe it was late, they were withdrawne already and aſleep, and by fortune the chamber where the Nymph was lodged, was of this ſort, and hard by theirs, without heeding it when ſhe lay downe, hearing one murmure hard by her bed (for the beds head ſtood that way, that ſhe might the better vnderſtand) ſhe layd her eare to an open place of the wall: and by chance one of them lifting vp his voyce ſomewhat higher, ſhe heard that he anſwer'd the other thus, What would you I ſhuld ſay more, but that loue makes you ſo impatient? And well either ſhe ſhall be found wearied, or ſicke, or diſtempered with ſome accident that hath made her ſtay. And muſt one deſpaire for that? <hi>Leonide</hi> thought ſhe knew the voyce, but ſhe could not remember it ſo well as the other, ſo ſoon as he anſwerd. But looke you, <hi>Climanthe,</hi> that is not the thing that puts mee to paine; for her, failing ſhal neuer hurt me ſo long as I hope to haue a good iſſue of our enterpriſe: that which I feare, and which layes mee on thornes as you ſee me, is, that you haue not well inſtructed her in what we deliberated, or elſe ſhee giues no credit to your words. <hi>Leonide</hi> hearing this diſcourſe, and knowing him well that ſpake, aſtoniſhed and deſirous to know more, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched ſo neere the wall, that ſhe loſt one word, and then heard <hi>Climan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the</hi> anſwere, God ſpeede me with this man.

And by miſ-hap (it ſeemeth) that <hi>Lindamor</hi> had a purpoſe to keepe his cloathes more ſecret then he did before. So it was, that as I went ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out ſome occaſion, one euening as he was in the midſt of the ſtreete, I heard him command one of his followers to go to the taylor that made his cloaths, to bring him the garment which he had cauſed to be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the day of ſhew, for that he would aſſay it: and becauſe hee had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly forbidden him, to let any one ſee it, he gaue him a ring for a token. I followed this man a far off, to know the lodging, and the morrow after in good time, knowing the name of the taylor, I entred boldly into his houſe, and told him I came from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> becauſe <hi>Amaſis</hi> preſſed him to be gone, &amp; that he feared thoſe garments would not be made in time, &amp; that I ſhould not giue credit to that hee ſhould ſay, but I ſhould ſee them my ſelfe to tell him the truth. And then going on, I ſayd, he would haue giuen me the ring you wote: but he ſayd to me, it would be ſufficient that I ſhould tell you, that yeſter-night hee had ſent for the garments, and markt the garments the beſt I could: and when I made ſhew of haſte, he anſwered it was time enough, for that, that very day he had ſeene a letter of <hi>Amaſis</hi> in the aſſembly of the towne, whereby ſhe ordained they ſhould put themſelues in armes within fiue weekes, becauſe that on the day which ſhe had appointed, ſhee would haue the aſſembly in their towne to make the generall muſter, which <hi>Lindamor</hi> and his troops were to make, to go to find <hi>Clidaman;</hi> and her wil was, that the next morning you ſhould be receiued for Generall of this countrey in his abſence. By this meanes I knew the day of <hi>Lindamors</hi> departure; and moreouer, that you were to ſtay in this country, which was an accident that fell out very luckily for our deſigne, thogh you were wel enough informed before. Following this, I drew aſide into the great wood of <hi>Sarignieu,</hi> where, on the ſhore of the little riuer that ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s a-croſſe, I made me a cabbinet of boughs, but ſo cloſe, that many paſſed by without ſeeing it; and I concealed it, to the end that men might thinke that I had kept it long: for, as you know, no man knew mee in this country: and the better to ſhew that I had long ſtayed there, the leaues with which I couered this Lodge, had beene long dry, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:177519:69"/>
then I tooke the great glaſſe which I had cauſed to be made, which I ſet on an Altar, which I raiſed of Hawes and Thornes, mingling them with ſome herbes, as Veruaine, Suckary, and ſuch other. On the one ſide, I pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Guy, which I ſayd to bee of Oke: on the other, the ſerpent of gold, which I fained to haue taken the ſixt of the firſt moone, and in the midſt, the ſheet in which I gathered it: and beſide al theſe, I hung the glaſſe in the darkeſt place, to the end my craft might be the leſſe perceiued: and iuſt ouer-againſt it, but ſomewhat higher, I fitted the painted paper, where I had drawne ſo liuely the place which I meant to ſhew <hi>Galathee,</hi> that there was no body but might know it, and that thoſe which were beneath, if they lifted vp their eyes, might not ſee it: on the ſide where I came in, I enterlaced boughs and leaues in ſuch fort together, that it was impaſſable; and becauſe, if they came on the other ſide, and turned to the contrary, without doubt they had eſpied my craft, I made round about a reaſonable great hedge, where I placed the Cenſers on a row, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade euery body to goe beyond them. Iuſt before the myrrour there was a table, whereon <hi>Hecathe</hi> was painted; and this table had the lower part of it wrought with ſteele, and, as you know, it hung by ſome horſe haires, ſo ſlender, that by reaſon of the darkeneſſe of the place, there was none could perceiue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: as ſoon as they were drawn away, the table falls, and with the weight ſtrucke with the ſteele on a flint, ſo purpoſely placed, that it neuer fayled of ſtriking fire. I had ſet in the ſame place a mixture of brimſtone and Salt-Peter, which ſhould take hold on the fire, in ſuch ſort, that it would raiſe a flame with ſuch ſuddenneſſe, that there was not the man that was not much aſtoniſhed. This I inuented, to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that it was either a diuinity, or an enchantment. So it was, that I found all this ſo well placed, that there was nothing to reforme. After all theſe things, I beganne to let my ſelfe be ſeene, but very rarely and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly: When I perceiued any man ſawe me, I drew to my Lodge, where I made ſhew to ſuſtayne my life onely with rootes, but in the night I went three or foure miles off, in other habites, to buy me all things neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Within ſome few dayes after, they tooke notice of me, and the bruite of my life was ſo great, that it came to the eares of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> who came often to walke in thoſe great gardens of <hi>Montbriſon.</hi> And among others, one time when ſhe was there, <hi>Sylore, Siluie, &amp; Leonide,</hi> and diuers other of their companions, came walking along my little riuer, where, at that time, I made ſhew to gather herbs: as ſoone as I knew they perceiued me, I went a great pace to my cabbin: they that were curious to ſee mee, and talke with me, followed me to the great trees. I had by this time ſet me on my
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:177519:69"/>
knees: But when I heard they approched, I came to the doore, where the firſt that I met with, was <hi>Leonide:</hi> and for that ſhe was ready to enter, thru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting her backe a little, I ſayd to her very rudely, <hi>Leonide,</hi> the Diuinity which I ſerue, commands you not to profane his Altars. At theſe words ſhe ſtept backe halfe amazed: for my habit of a Druyde made them giue me honour, and the name of the Diuinity gaue me feare, and after ſhee was aſſured, ſhe ſaid to me: The Altars of your God, whoſoeuer he be, cannot be profaned by receiuing my vowes, ſince I come but to render the honor which heauen demands of vs. Heauen (anſwered I) demaunds, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, vowes and honour, but not differing from that they ordaine: ſo that if the zeale of the Diuinity which I ſerue, hath brought you hither, then muſt you obſerue that which it commaunds. And what is his commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, ſayd <hi>Siluie? Siluie</hi> (ſayd I) if you haue the ſame intent that your companion hath, doe you both that which I tell you, and then your vowes ſhall be pleaſing to him. Before the Moone begin to wane, waſh your right leg to the knee before day, and the arme to the elbow, within this riuer that runnes before this holy Caue: And then, the leg and arme being naked, come hither with a garland of Veruine, and a girdle of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corie; after that I will tell you what you are to doe to be partakers of the ſacred myſteries of this place, which I will open and declare to you. And then taking her by the hand, I ſayd, Will you, for teſtimony of the graces wherewith the diuinity whom I ſerue, fauours me, that I tell you part of your life, and what ſhall befall you? Not I (ſayd ſhe) for I haue no ſuch curioſity. But you, my companion (ſayd ſhe) (addreſſing her ſelfe to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onide)</hi> I haue ſeene you heretofore deſirous to know it. Now ſatisfie your deſire, I beſeech you (ſayd <hi>Leonide)</hi> preſenting her hand to me. Then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that that you told me of theſe Nymphes in particular, I tooke her hand, and asked her, if ſhe were borne in the day or night; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was in the night, I tooke her left hand, and after I had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiderd of it, I ſaid, This line of life, clean, wel mark'd, &amp; long, ſhews that you ſhall liue, from the diſeaſes of your body, in good health: but this little croſſe which is in the ſame line, almoſt at height of the angles, which hath two little lines aboue, and three beneath, and theſe three alſo which are at the end of the line of life towards the turning, ſhew in you the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which Loue ſhall giue you, which will hinder you from that health of ſpirit, which you haue of body. And thoſe fiue or ſixe points, which (like little graines) are ſowed heere and there on the ſame line, make me iudge, that you neuer will hate them that loue you, but rather, that you delight to be beloued and ſerued.</p>

Now marke this other line, which takes his root from that we haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken of; and paſſing through the middle of the hand, lifts it ſelfe againſt the mount of the Moone, they call it the naturall Meane: thoſe cuttings that you ſee, which skant appeare, ſignifie that you are eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with them, ouer whom Loue giues you authority. And this little ſtarre which turnes againſt the ground of the pulſe, ſhewes that you are full of bounty and ſweeteneſſe, and that quickly you will loſe your choler.</p>
                  <p>But behold, this line which we call <hi>Menſale,</hi> that ioyneth with the meanes naturall (ſo that they two make one angle) this ſheweth you ſhall haue diuers troubles in plotting for loue, which will make your life ſome-whiles vnpleaſing; which I iudge the rather, conſidering that ſoone after the meane failes; and that meets with that of life, ſo that they ſeeme to be the angle of the <hi>Menſale</hi> and of the other; but this tells mee, that late or neuer you ſhall haue the concluſion of your deſires. I would haue gone on, when ſhe tooke away her hand, and ſayd, this was not the thing ſhe demaunded: for I ſpeake too much in generall, but ſhe would cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know what would become of a doſſigne which ſhe had. Then I anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red her: The heauenly powers themſelues onely know that which is to come: but onely that that by their bounty they giue knowledge of to their ſeruants, and that ſometimes for the publike good, ſometimes to ſatisfie the ardent ſupplication of them that often importune their Altars; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times to ſhew, that nothing is hidden from them: and yet it is the part of a wiſe Interpreter, to tell nothing but what he thinketh neceſſary, becauſe the ſecrets of the gods are not to be divulged without cauſe. I tell you this, that your curioſity might content it ſelfe, that I haue diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with leſſe cleereneſſe then you deſire; for, it is not neceſſary I ſhould ſay otherwiſe vnto you. And that you may know that God is not ſo spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of his graces, but that he talketh familiarly with me: I will tell you the things which haue befalne you, by which you may iudge how much I know.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place (fayre Nymphs) you know, I neuer ſawe you before, and yet at the firſt meeting, I called you all by your names; which I did, for that I am willing you ſhould thinke mee to know more then the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, not to the end that any glory ſhould befall me (that were too great a preſumption) but to the Deity which I ſerue in this place. Now you muſt beleeue, that all that I ſhall ſay to you, I haue learned from the ſame Maſter: and in this I lyed not, for it was you, <hi>Polemas,</hi> that told mee it: but becauſe (continued I) it may be, the particularities will make me o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The firſt time that in earneſt he made his ouerture, was, when <hi>Amaſis</hi> going to walke in the faire gardens of <hi>Montbriſon,</hi> hee tooke you vnder the arme, &amp; after he had ſtayed ſome while without ſpeech, he told you at laſt, Faire Nymph, it is not for nothing that I diſpute in myſelfe, whether I ſhould, or whether I ſhould not declare that which I haue in my ſoule; for to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, may bee allowed in that which may ſometimes bee changed: but that which conſtraines mee to ſpeake at this time, ſhall accompany me euen to my Tombe. Here I ſtayed, and ſayd to her, Will you haue me repeat <hi>(Leonide)</hi> the ſame words which you anſwered?

I boldly told her all that had paſſed at that time, knowing, Loue would not ſuffer that one ſhould conceale any thing, from the perſon whom they loue. But to come againe to our purpoſe, ſhe anſwered, I am willing you ſhuld ſay what you pleaſe,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:177519:71"/>
but we will beleeue what we liſt. This ſhe ſaid, as beeing a little pricked with that which ſhee would ſhould haue beene concealed from her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. I went on: Well, <hi>Leonide,</hi> you may beleeue what you pleaſe, for I aſſure my ſelfe, that I haue ſaid nothing, which in your ſoule you haue not found for true. You anſwered him as ſeeming not to vnderſtand what he would ſay. You haue reaſon, <hi>Agis,</hi> not to hide by diſſimulation, that which muſt accompany you ſo long as you liue; otherwiſe it beeing impoſſible but it muſt be diſcouered, you ſhall be taken for a double per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a name which is honourable to no ſort of people, but much leſſe to them who make the profeſſion that you doe. This counſell then (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hee) and my paſſion, conſtraine mee to tell you (faire Nymph) that neither the inequality of your merits to me, nor the ſmall good will which I haue found in you, could not hinder my affection nor my boldneſſe, that they haue not rayſed me vp to you, ſo that if not the quality of the gift, but the will is to be receiued, I may ſay with aſſurance, that none can of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you a greater ſacrifice: for that heart which I giue you, I giue with all the affections, and with all the powers of my ſoule: and ſo all that, which after this deuotion is not found to be yours, I diſauow and renounce it as not appertaining to me.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion was that you anſwered, <hi>Agis,</hi> I will beleeue theſe words, when the time and your ſeruices ſhall haue told me them, as well as your mouth. See the firſt declaration of amity which you had of him, whereof afterwards he gaue you ſuch proofe, as well by ſute hee made to marry you, as by the quarrells which he had againſt many, whom hee was iealous of. It was at that time, that when you would haue frizeled your haire, you burnt your cheeke, whereupon he made this verſe.</p>

                  <p>And to make it appeare to you, that I truely know theſe things by a diuinity which canot lie, whoſe eie &amp; eare perceth euen to the depth of the heart, I will tell you a thing on this ſubiect, that no man could know but you and <hi>Agis.</hi> She was afraid I would diſcouer ſome ſecret which would anger he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>; and it was my purpoſe to giue her that apprehenſion: and that was the cauſe that ſhe ſayd to me (much diſquieted) Man of God, though I beleeue not but that you and others may ſay that on this ſubiect which imports me, yet this diſcourſe is ſo ſenſible, that it will bee hard to handle it with ſo gentle an hand, but the wound will bleed: therefore I beſeech you to make an end. She vttered theſe words with ſuch a change of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and a voyce ſo broken, that for her better aſſurance, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to ſay, You are not to thinke me of ſo ſmall a conſideration, that I know not how to conceale that which may offend you; nor that I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, that the leaſt wounds are ſenſible enough in that part which I touch; for it is to the heart that all theſe ſtrokes are directed: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you will know no more, I will hold my peace. And it is time that I goe to the Diuinity that calls me. And at that inſtant I aroſe, and gaue them the good day. Then after I had made ſome ſhewes of ceremonies o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the riuer, I ſayd very loud; O ſoueraigne Deity! which abideſt in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:177519:72"/>
this place, behold, how with this water I cleanſe my ſelfe, and vncloath me of all the prophaneneſſe which the conuerſing among men might leaue in me, ſince I came out of thy holy Temple. At theſe words I dipped my hands thrice into the water: and then taking vp in the hollow of the one, I receiued it thrice into my mouth, my eyes and hands lifted vp to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and ſo went to my Cabbin without ſpeaking to them, and becauſe I doubted they had the curioſity to come ſee what I did, I went before the Altar, where making a ſhew to caſt my ſelfe on the ground, I drew out the horſe haires, which taking their effect, let the little ſteele table that ſtood before the glaſſe, fall, which fell ſo to purpoſe on the flint, that it ſtrucke fire, and inſtantly tooke hold on the compoſition which was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, ſo that the flame burſt forth ſo ſuddainely, that the Nymphs which were at the doore, ſeeing at the firſt the Mirrour gliſter, and preſently the fire ſo ſuddaine and violent, tooke ſuch a feare, that they returned with great opinion both of my holineſſe, &amp; of the reſpect to the diuinity which I ſerue. Could this beginning bee better carried then it was? No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly (anſwered <hi>Polemas)</hi> and I thinke well, for my part, that euery body which had not knowne of it before, might be eaſily deceiued.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Climanthe</hi> talked thus, <hi>Leonide</hi> harkened to it, ſo rauiſhed from her ſelfe, that ſhe knew not whether ſhe ſlept or waked: for ſhe ſaw well, that all that he told her, was very true, yet could ſhe not well beleeue that it was ſo; and while ſhe diſputed in her ſelfe, ſhe heard <hi>Climanthe</hi> beginne againe. Now theſe Nymphs went away, and I could not know what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port they would giue of me, yet by coniecture, there was no likeli-hood, but they: would tell to euery one the admirable things which they had ſeene, and as renowne increaſes alwaies, the Court was full of nothing but of me. And at that time I had much adoe to continue my enterpriſe, for an infinite company came to ſee mee; ſome of curioſity, others to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, and many to know, if that which they talked of me was ſo: And I was driuen to vſe great cunning. Sometimes to auoyd them, I gaue out that that day was a mute day for the Deity that I ſerued; another time, that ſome body had diſpleaſed it, and that it would not anſwer vntill I had appeaſed it by faſting: another time, I ſet downe conditions for the ceremonies which I cauſed to vſe, which they could not performe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome good time: and ſometimes when all was finiſhed, I found mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſay, that either they had not well obſerued all, or that they had done too much or too little; and ſo I made them begin againe, and went winning time. As for them whom I knew any thing by, I diſpatched them quickly, and that was the cauſe, that others deſirous to know as
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:177519:72"/>
much as the former, ſubmitted themſelues to what I would. Now du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time, <hi>Amaſis</hi> came to ſee mee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and with her <hi>Galathee.</hi> After I had ſatisfied <hi>Amaſis</hi> about that which ſhee de maunded, which was in ſumme, to know what the voyage ſhould be that <hi>Clidaman</hi> had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken, and I had told her, that he ſhould runne an happy fortune, that hee ſhould be wounded, and be in three battels with the Prince of <hi>France,</hi> but that in the end, he ſhould returne with all ſort of honour and glorie: ſhe went from me wonderfully contented, and deſired mee to commend her ſonne to the Deity which I ſerued. But <hi>Galathee</hi> much more curious then her mother, drawing me aſide, ſaid; Father, bind me, intelling me, what you know of my fortune. Then I ſaid, ſhe ſhould ſhew me her hand: I ſtood looking on it ſome-while, and made her ſcratch thrice vpon the ground: and hauing ſet the left foote forward, I turned her towards the Eaſt, and there made her looke vpward. I took the meaſure of her foote, and of her hand; after that, the compaſſe of her necke: and with that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I meaſured the girdle, in height: and in the end, looking at once on both her hands, I ſaid, <hi>Galathee,</hi> you are happy, if you knew your houre, &amp; thrice-happy, if you let it not paſſe, either out of coldnes, or for loue, or wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of courage. But if you make not your ſelf incapable of that good whereto heauen hath deſtinated you, you can not wiſh to attaine to more happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and all that good, or all that euill is prepared you by loue. Be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed then to take firme reſolution, not to ſuffer your ſelfe to be intangled with the perſwaſions of Loue, nor the counſell of friends, nor commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of parents; which vnleſſe you do, I thinke there is not any thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heauen ſo miſerable as you ſhalbe. O God! ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> you amaze me.</p>
                  <p>Be not amazed, ſaid I: for that which I tell you, is but to your good, and that you may carry your ſelfe with all wiſedome, I will diſcouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you all that the Diuinity that inſtructed me ſhal permit; but remember to keepe it ſo ſecret, that you truſt no liuing creature with it. After ſhee had promiſed mee, I continued in this ſort: Daughter, for the office whereunto the gods haue called mee (ſuffer me ſo to name you) you are, and ſhall be ſerued of many great and worthy Knights, whoſe ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and merits may diuerſly excite and mooue you; but if you ſhall meaſure your affection, either by your merites, or by the iudgement you ſhall haue of their loue and fauour, and not according to that that I ſhall declare vnto you, you fill your ſelfe as full of misfortune, as any creature out of the graces and fauours of the gods may in any wiſe bee. For I which am the Interpreter of their will and pleaſure, in telling you
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:177519:73"/>
this, I take from you all excuſe of igaorance, ſo that now you are diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to them, if you doe contrary; and you know, that the heauens rather demaund obedience and ſubmiſſion, rather then any other ſacrifice: and therefore bethinke your ſelfe well of what I am to tell you. That day that the Bacchanals runne thorow the ſtreets raging and ſtorming, full of the Euthuſiaſme of their god, you muſt be in the towne of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> where many gallant Knights ſhall ſee you. But take good heede to him that is clothed with cloth of gold, and greene, and whoſe whole ſuite ſhall be of that colour: if you loue him, I henceforth bewayle your misfortune, and you cannot ſay other, but that you ſhall be the marke of all diſaſters, and of all misfortune, for you ſhall then feele that which I may not tell you. Father, anſwered ſhe (ſomewhat aſtoniſhed) I know a good remedy for this, not to loue at all. My childe (replied I) this remedy is very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, for that, not onely you may diſpleaſe the gods, in doing that which they will not, but alſo, in not doing that which they will. Therefore take heede to your ſelfe. And how (replied ſhe) muſt I behaue my ſelfe? I haue told you heeretofore (anſwered I) what you ought not to doe: at this time I will tell you what you ought to do.</p>
                  <p>It is neceſſary in the firſt place, that you know that all things corporall or ſpiritual, haue euery one their contraries, and their ſympathiſants, from the leaſt we may come to the proofe of the greateſt: but for the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which you ought to haue, this diſcourſe may be vnprofitable; and, this that I ſay to you, is to no other end, but to cauſe you giue the better heed, that as you haue this misfortune contrary to your happineſſe, ſo haue you a deſtiny ſo capable of making you happy, that your felicity can not be expreſſed; and in this the gods will recompence that, to which they haue ſubiected you. Since it is ſo (anſwered ſhe) I coniure you, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Diuinity which you ſerue, to tell me what it is. It is (ſayd I) another man, whom if you eſpouſe, you ſhall liue with all the happineſſe that a mortall may haue. And who is he? Preſently anſwered <hi>Galathee:</hi> Fayre Nymph, that which I ſpeake, commeth not from my ſelfe, but from <hi>Hecate,</hi> whom I ſerue. So that if I ſay no more, thinke not it commeth from want of will, but it is becauſe ſhe hath not, as yet, diſcouered it vnto me.</p>
                  <p>But if you haue a longing, obſerue the things that I ſhall tell you, and you ſhall know what ſhall be neceſſary. For though the gods do good to men that pleaſe them liberally; yet will they be knowne to be gods, and the ſacrifices of mortals delight them as acknowledgements which they giue, not to be vnthanke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ull for the benefits receiued. After ſome other
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:177519:73"/>
talke, this Nymph, being much prouoked, ſayd vnto me, that ſhe deſired no more, and that ſhee would obſerue all that which I ſhould ordayne. Now is time, at this inſtant (ſayd I) for the Moone is at the full, or little wanting; and if you ſuffer it to wane, you can doe no more. And then I gaue her the ſame commaundement, which I had done before to <hi>Siluie</hi> and <hi>Leonide,</hi> to waſh before day in the next riuer, the legge and the arme, and to come in that ſort, with a garland of Veruine, and a girdle of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cory, before this caue, and that I would prepare things neceſſary for the ſacrifice: but there muſt be care that thoſe which be preſent, be in other ſtate then ſhe. Well, ſaid ſhe, I will come with two of my Nymphs, and that ſo ſecretly, that no man ſhall know of it; but take heed you ſpeake not before them, ſo that they take knowledge of this affaire, for they will labour to diuert me. I was much eaſed at this aduertiſement, hauing had the ſame feare; ſo that ſeeing her to haue ſuch prouidence, I iudged ſhe had a purpoſe to follow my aduice, otherwiſe ſhe would neuer haue bene ſo carefull. Then went ſhe away, with aſſurance to returne the third day after. Now that which made me ſay, that it muſt be before the Moone wane, was, that if any others came to importune me in the like things, I might finde excuſe by the wane of the Moone, and ſo I ſaid, it muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore day, that there might be the fewer perſons: and for the day of Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanals, I made account, that it would be the day when <hi>Lindamor</hi> was to take his leaue of <hi>Amaſis</hi> at <hi>Marſellis,</hi> and conſequently, of her, and that he ſhould be clad in greene. Now all theſe things thus reſolued and prepared, I gaue order to prouide that which ſhould be needfull for the ſacrifice which we were to make the third day. For though I knew not that my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery very well, yet muſt I make my ſelfe ſeeme expert therein, that they that were better acquainted with it, might find nothing to gaine-ſay. You know, that from the beginning we had made our preparation, and we had giuen order to prouide all that was neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The morning being come, the day beganne ſcarce to peepe, before I found her in ſtate I ordayned her with <hi>Siluie</hi> and <hi>Leonide,</hi> and without fiction, I wiſhed then, that you had bene there, to haue enioyed content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to behold that faire, whoſe haire (at the pleaſure of the winde) hung wauing about vncouered; but with a Garland of Veruine you ſhould haue ſeene that arme naked, and that legge white like Alabaſter, all full &amp; poliſhed, ſo that there was no apparance of bone; the thigh, long and ſtreight, the foote ſmall and fine, which ſhame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thoſe of <hi>Thetis.</hi> I muſt tell you true, I delayed the time the more, that I might the better behold thoſe beauties; ſo that I told them that they were to perfume all
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:177519:74"/>
their body with Incenſe, mixed with brimſtone, that the viſions and dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Stix</hi> might not offend them, and ſhewed them a fit place for that purpoſe, ſome what remoued aſide, where they could hardly be ſeene.</p>
                  <p>Vpon the winding of the next hill, whoſe feete this little riuer waters, there groweth a Boxe tree, ſpreading branch vpon branch, with diuers leaues, whoſe twigges hauing neuer beene rounded with any toole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that wood is dedicated to <hi>Diane,</hi> the one reaching and ſhaddowing the one the other; ſo that hardly can the Sunne pierce thorow, either at his riſing or ſetting, and at noone, a kinde of twi-light compaſſeth it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily.</p>
                  <p>This place thus fit, encouraged them, but much more the curioſity of knowing what they deſired. Then after they had taken the perfumes ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, they went to vncloath themſelues all three. And I, which well knew the place, ſtepping ouer the riuer, came on the other ſide where they were, and had the commodity to ſee them naked. Without faining, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in my life ſaw any thing ſo beautifull: but among all, I found <hi>Leonide</hi> admirable, what for the proportion of her body, what for the whiteneſſe of her skinne, or ſoundneſſe of complexion, ſhe ſurpaſſed them much, ſo as I condemned you as a man vnexpert in beauties, for leauing her for <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathee,</hi> who in truth hath ſome good fauour in her face; but for the reſt, ſo poorly ſorting with that ſhe would ſeeme, that in reaſon ſhe may call her ſelfe an abuſer.

before my Caue, where I made a ditch for the Sacrifice: for that preſently when they beganne to cloath themſelues, I returned and had the leaſure to make a good party. I digged a trench ſome foure foote about, and then I made three fires about it, with Incenſe of Smallage and Poppey, and with a Cenſer I perfumed the place three times about, and as often my Cabbin; and then I couered the body with Veruine, and made euery one of them a Crowne of Poppeys, and put in their mouth ſome ſalt, which I made them chew. Afterwards, I tooke three black Heyfers, and the faireſt that I could chooſe, which had neuer beene knowne of the Ram, whoſe haire black and long was like ſilke, it was ſo ſoft and pleaſant: I draue theſe beaſts, without felling, to the ditch, where turning me to the Eaſt ſide, I took hold on them on the head with my left hand, and with my right, I tooke the haire which grew betweene the hornes, and put it into the Cruze, mingling it together with milke, flowre, wine, and honey; and after I had foure times called <hi>Hecate,</hi> I thruſt the knife into the heart of the Beaſts, one after another, and ſaued the blood in a baſm; and then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling againe on <hi>Hecate,</hi> I powred it by little and little. Then thinking there remained nothing to doe more, I rayſed my ſelfe on tip-toe, and doing like one tranſported, I ſaid to the Nymphs, It is time, and taking <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee</hi> by the hand, we entered all foure in. I was made gaſtly, I looked ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, mine eyes rowling in my head, my mouth gaping, and my body ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with the holy Eutheuſiaſme. Being neere the Altar, I ſaid, O holy Deity, which abideſt in this place, grant mee, that I may anſwere this Nymph truely, about that which ſhe demands. The place was darke, and there was no light, but that which two little candles gaue, which were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

made the fire accuſtomed, with a flame ſo quicke, that <hi>Galathee</hi> was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed with feare. But I held her, and ſayd; Nymph, be not afraid, this is <hi>Hecate,</hi> who ſhewes you that which you demaund. Then the ſmoke, by little and little, vaniſhing, the Looking-glaſſe might be ſeene, but ſomewhat troubled with the darknes of the ſmoke, which was the cauſe, that taking a wet ſpunge which hung by for that purpoſe vpon a Cane, I wiped twice or thrice on the Glaſſe, which made it cleere; and by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, the Sunne roſe at that time, ſhining ſo fitly on the painted paper, that it ſhewed ſo liuely in the Glaſſe, as I could wiſh. After they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it ſome-while, I ſayd to <hi>Galathee:</hi> Remember (Nymph) that <hi>Hecate</hi> makes thee know by me, that in that place which thou feeſt repreſented in this myrrour, thou ſhalt finde a Diamond halfe loſt, which a faire and ouer-ſcornefull hath diſ-eſteemed, thinking it to be falſe, and yet it is of ineſtimable valew: take it, and keepe it curiouſly.</p>
                  <p>Now this riuer is <hi>Lignon,</hi> this is <hi>Sanlag</hi> which is there, this is the coaſt of <hi>Mont-verdun,</hi> vnder that hill, where it ſeemed the riuer had his courſe heretofore. Marke well the place, and remember it. Afterwards, leading the Nymph aſide, I ſayd: My childe, you haue (as I haue told you) an influence infinitely malicious, and another moſt fortunate as one would wiſh; the malicious I haue told, keepe you from it, if you loue your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. The good is that which you ſee in this Glaſſe: marke then well the place which I haue cauſed you to ſee: and that you may the better remember it, after I haue done ſpeaking to you, returne to ſee it, and note it well: for the day that the Moone ſhall be in the ſame ſtate that it is in now, about this very houre, or a little ſooner or later, you ſhall find him whom you ought to loue. If he ſee you before you ſee him, he ſhall loue you, but hardly ſhall you loue him: on the contrary, if you ſee him firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſhall haue ſomewhat to doe to loue you, and you ſhall preſently loue him. Now muſt you, by your wiſedome, ouercome this contrariety; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolue then, both to vanquiſh your ſelfe, and him (if need be,) for without doubt, in time, you ſhall hit on him: if you find him not the firſt time, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne the next Moone after at the ſame day, about the ſame houre; and do ſo the third time, if you meete him not at the ſecond. <hi>Hecate</hi> will not make the day certaine to me.</p>
                  <p>It pleaſeth the gods to mixe paine in that they giue vs, that obedience which herein we render them, may witneſſe how we eſteeme them. Then taking a little ſticke, I came to the looking glaſſe, and pointed with it to euery place. Behold (ſayd I) the mountaine of <hi>Iſoure,</hi> ſee the <hi>Mont-uer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dun,</hi> ſee the riuer of <hi>Lignon.</hi> Here ſee you a lake on the ſhore of it there,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:177519:75"/>
and a little lower <hi>la Pra:</hi> you may well remember it, hauing paſſed often that way as you hunted. Now, Nymph, <hi>Hecate</hi> ſends you word by me, that if you obſerue not that which ſhe ſets down to you, as you haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed her, ſhe wil augment the miſ-fortune which the Deſtinies threaten. And then a little changing my voyce, I ſayd, And I am right glad, that before my departure I haue bin ſo happy too, as to giue you this aduice: for though I be not of this country, yet ſo it is, that your vertue, and your piety to the gods, haue bound mee to loue you, and to beſeech <hi>Hecate</hi> that ſhe would preſerue and make you happy; and by this you may ſee I am wholy belonging to that goddeſſe, ſince ſhe, hauing commanded mee to departhence, to morrow without gaine-ſaying I am reſolued, and bid you adeiu. At this word I led them out of my cabbin, &amp; taking from them the herbes I had ſet about them, I burnt them in the fire, which as yet was flaming, and then withdrew my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>I will now tell you, why I ſaid, It was at the full moone, for you were angry that I gaue her ſo long terme: I did it, to the end that <hi>Lindamor</hi> might bee gone before ſhee went, there being no likelihood that <hi>Amaſis</hi> would ſuffer her before: and then, you that were to take the charge of all the Prouince, muſt haue ſome time to ſtay about <hi>Amaſis,</hi> after the going away of all the knights, to beginne to ſet things in order; whereas if ſo preſently you ſhould haue gone to hunt, euery one might haue murmured: for you know how much a man that deales in matters of ſtate, is ſubiect to enuie and ſlander. I gaue three moones after, to the end that if you falle one day, you might be there another. I told her, that if ſhee ſaw you firſt, that ſhee ſhould eaſily fall in loue with you; that if it were you, it ſhould be otherwiſe: and that only, becauſe I knew well that you ſhould ſee her firſt: ſo that ſhe ſhould find this difficulty of Loue true in her ſelfe; for as you know, ſhe loued <hi>Lindamor.</hi> I told her I muſt bee gone the next day, that ſhe ſhould not thinke it ſtrange, if ſhe came to ſeeke me out for ſome curioſity: for hauing performed that which wee reſolue on, I had reaſon to make haſte, that I might not bee knowne of any Druide, who would haue cauſed me to bee puniſhed, and you know well, that hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes bene my feare. Thinke you, I haue forgot any thing? No certaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſayd <hi>Polemas:</hi> but what might that be, that hath kept her backe ſo long time? For my part (ſayd <hi>Climanthe)</hi> I know not, except it bee, for that ſhee hath miſ-taken the daies of the moone: but ſince no buſineſſe preſſes you, and you may yet ſtay here the time that I haue ſet her, I would aduiſe you to do it, and euery morning two dayes before, and after, you faile not to goe in good time; for it is true, that the firſt day wee were too late. And
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:177519:76"/>
what will you (ſayd <hi>Polemas)</hi> that I ſhould do? The loſſe of the ſhepheard that drowned himſelfe, was the cauſe: and you know, the ſhore of the riuer was ſo full of folke, that I could not ſtay there alone without ſuſpicion: but wee haue not foreſlowed much, and there is no likelihood that ſhee was there that day: for I aſſure my ſelfe, that the ſame occaſion which hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred me, hath likewiſe ſtayd her, leſt ſhe ſhuld be ſeen. You ſhal neuer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade mee ſo, (replied <hi>Climanthe)</hi> ſhee was too deſirous to obſerue that which I appointed. But it ſeemes to be time to riſe that you may be gone: and then opening the windowes, he ſaw the day breake. Without doubt (ſayd he) before you be at the place where you ſhuld be, the houre will be paſt: make haſte; for it is better to haue many houres to ſpare, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t too ſhort. And will you (ſayd <hi>Polemas)</hi> that wee go now, being more then 15. dayes ſince the time is paſt? It may be, ſhe hath reckoned wrong: let vs not faile to finde her. <hi>Leonide,</hi> who feared to be ſeene either of <hi>Polemas</hi> or <hi>Climanthe,</hi> durſt not riſe before they were gone: and that ſhee might know the face of <hi>Climanthe,</hi> when it was day, ſhe beheld him ſo, that ſhee thought it impoſſible hee could diſguiſe himſelfe to her: and as ſoone as ſhe ſaw they were out of the houſe, ſhe dreſſed her ſelfe, and hauing taken leaue of her hoaſt, held on her voiage ſo confuſed in her ſelfe, at the mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious impoſtures of theſe two perſons, that ſhe thoght any other might as well bee deceiued as ſhee: ſo it was, that the ſmall eſteeme which <hi>Polemas</hi> made of her beauty, ſtrucke her ſo to the quicke, that ſhe reſolued to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent his malice with her wiſedome, and to worke ſo, that <hi>Lindamor,</hi> in his abſence, might not feele the effects of this treaſon, which ſhe thought ſhe could not better do, then by the meane of her vncle <hi>Adamas,</hi> to whom ſhe had a purpoſe to declare all that ſhe knew. In this reſolution ſhe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted to go to <hi>Feurs,</hi> where ſhe thought to find him, but ſhe came too late: for that morning hee was gone home-wards, hauing the day before diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched that which belonged to the ſacrifice. And the Sun began to wax hot, by that time he came into the plaine of <hi>Mont-Verdun:</hi> and becauſe on the left hand he perceiued a tuft of trees, which as he thoght, gaue a loue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaddow, hee turned his ſtep thither to reſt himſelfe a little. As ſoone as hee was there, hee ſpied afar off a ſhepheard comming, that ſeemed to ſeeke out that place for the ſame cauſe that brought him: and becauſe hee ſeemed to bee very ſad when hee came, leſt hee might draw him from his thought, hee would not ſalute him, but without ſhewing himſelfe to him, he would harken what he went talking to himſelfe: and ſhortly after he was ſet down on the other ſide of the buſh, he heard him vſe theſe words, And why ſhould I loue this fleeter? In the firſt place her beauty cannot
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:177519:76"/>
conſtraine me: for it is not enough to giue her the name of faire, and then her merits are not ſuch, as if they be not ayded with other conſiderations, may hold an honeſt man in her ſeruice: and laſtly, her loue, which was all that bound me to her, is ſo changeable, that if ſhe haue any impreſſion of loue in her hart, I think, it be not only of wax, but of wax newly wrought, ſhe ſo eaſily takes the figures of al nouelties; and it is like her eyes, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the figures of all that is repreſented to them, but loſe them, as ſoone as the obiect is no more before them, that is, I loue her, I muſt avow, it is becauſe I thinke ſhee loues mee: but if it be not ſo, I excuſe her, for I know well, ſhe thinks ſhe loues me. This ſhepheard had gone on, but a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe by fortune came to him, who ſeemed to haue followed him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off; and though ſhee heard ſome words of her ſelfe, yet made ſhe no ſhew, but now contrary ſitting downe by him, ſhee ſayd, Well, <hi>Corilas,</hi> what new care is this that makes you ſo ſad? The ſhepheard anſwered her as diſdainefully as hee could, without turning his head on that ſide: It is that which makes me ſearch, with what new deceit you will beare them, whom from this time you ſhall beginne to loue. And why, ſayd the ſhepheardeſſe, can you beleeue that I affect any other then you? And you, ſayd the ſhepheard, can you beleeue that I thinke you affect me? What thinke you then of me, ſayd the ſhepheardeſſe? All the worſt (anſwered <hi>Corilas)</hi> that you can beleeue from a man whom you hate. You haue (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhe) ſtrange opinions of me. And you (ſaid <hi>Corilas)</hi> ſtrange effects in you. O God (ſayd the ſhepheardeſſe) what a man haue I found in you? It is I (anſwered the ſhepheard) that with more reaſon may retort it on you, <hi>Stelle,</hi> what a woman haue I found: for there is nothing more capable of loue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you, you, I ſay, who take no delite but to deceiue thoſe that truſt in you, and who imitate the huntſman, who purſueth the beaſt with ſuch care, whoſe heart afterwards he giues to his dogs. You haue, ſaid ſhee, ſo ſmall reaſon in that you ſay, as he ſhould haue leſſe that will ſtay to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere you. I would to God (ſaid the ſhepheard) I might alwayes haue as much in my ſoule, as I haue now in my words; I ſhould not haue that ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row that afflicts me. And after they had both held their peace awhile, ſhe raiſed her voyce, and ſpake, ſinging to him in this ſort, &amp; he likewiſe, that ſhe might not want anſwer, replied.</p>

<pb n="156" facs="tcp:177519:78"/>
this opinion, ſo that it is in vaine for you to try your armes againſt mee, they are too feeble, I feare their blowes no more: I counſell you to proue them on others, whoſe knowledge may make them miſprize them as I haue done. It cannot be but you ſhall finde ſome, whom the heauens (to puniſh ſome ſecret fault) haue ordained to loue you, and they ſhall be the more pleaſing to you, for that nouelty delights you aboue all things. At this bout, the ſhepheardeſſe was ſtung in earneſt: but fayning to turne the offence into laughter, ſhe ſaid as ſhe was going away, I make good ſport, <hi>Corilas,</hi> both at your ſelfe and your choler, we ſhall ſee you ſhortly in your good humour. In the meane time, be content that I patiently ſuffer your fault, which you caſt on me. I know (replyed the ſhepheard) it is your cuſtome to make ſport with them that loue you. But if the humor which I haue, laſt, I aſſure you, you may longer play vpon me, then on a man that ſhall loue you. So parted theſe two enemies; and <hi>Adamas,</hi> who had heard them, hauing knowledge by their names, of the families of which they were, was deſirous to know more of their affaires: and calling <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas</hi> by his name, made him turne to him: and becauſe the ſhepheard ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be aſtoniſhed at this ſurprize, for the reſpect which is had to the habite and quality of a Druyde, that he might be more aſſured, he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to ſit downe by him, and then talked thus vnto him: My childe, (for ſo I may call you) for the loue I haue alwayes borne to them of your family, there is no cauſe you ſhould be ſorry for your ſpeaking ſo freely to <hi>Stelle</hi> before me. I am glad that I haue ſeene your wiſedome: but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to know more, that I may the better counſell you in this affaire, that thereby you may commit no errour. And for me, I know not that there ſhould be any difficulty, ſince the lawes of coiuility and curteſie do more binde me (it may be) then you may imagine. As ſoone as <hi>Corilas</hi> had the ſight of the Druyde, he knew him well, hauing often ſeene him at diuers ſacrifices; but hauing neuer ſpoken to him, he had not the boldneſſe to tell thorowout what had paſſed between <hi>Stelle</hi> and him, though he much deſired, that euery one might know the iuſtice of his cauſe, and the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnes of this ſhepheardeſſe: which <hi>Adamas</hi> perceiuing, that he might encourage him, gaue him to vnderſtand, that he knew a good part already, and that many had reported it to his wrong, which hee heard with no great pleaſure, for the loue he had alwaies borne to his. It will (ſaid <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilas)</hi> be loſſe of time for you to heare the particularities of our villages. So far is it (replied he:) it ſhalbe a great ſatisfaction, to know that you haue not beene wronged; and beſides, I meane to paſſe away ſome part of the heate here, and ſo the time may be employed.</p>

It is a good while ſince <hi>Stelle</hi> remained the widdow of an husband whom the heauens had giuen her, rather for name ſake, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> effect; for beſides that he was ſickly, his age, which drew neer to 75. yeeres, ſo weakened his forces, that it conſtrained him to leaue this young widdow, almoſt before ſhe was truely married: the loue ſhe bare him, wrought in her no great feeling of his loſſe, no more did her humor, which was neuer wonted to take neere to heart, the accidents that befell her. Remaining then well ſatisfied in her ſelfe, ſo ſee her ſelfe freed at one blow, of two ſo heauy burthens; to wit, the importunity of an angry huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, &amp; the autority which her pare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts accuſtomed to haue ouer her, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſhe thruſt her ſelfe in good earneſt, into the world: and though her beauty ſuch as you ſee, bee not of that ſort that may tempt men to loue her, yet her behauiour, for the moſt part, diſpleaſed not them that ſaw her. She might be about 17. or 18. yeeres: an age fit enough to commit many follies when they be at liberty. This was the cauſe, that <hi>Saliam</hi> her brother, an honeſt and wiſe ſhepheard, and one of the beſt friends I had, not able to indure her licentious and vſuall behauiour, that he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue her of ſuch occaſions, reſolued to ſend her farre from her Hamlet, and place her in ſuch company, where ſhee might paſſe her more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous age without reproach. For effecting this, he prayed <hi>Cleanthe</hi> to like well, that ſhe might be a companion to his little daughter, <hi>Aminthe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were about an age, though <hi>Stelle</hi> were ſome deale older. And becauſe <hi>Cleantho</hi> liked well of it, they began a life ſo priuate and ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, that theſe two ſhepheardeſſes were neuer the one without the other, many wondring, that being ſo differing in humor; they could be ſo ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioyned; but the ſweete behauiour of <hi>Aminthe,</hi> and the ſupple nature of <hi>Stelle,</hi> cauſed it, and ſo <hi>Aminthe</hi> neuer withſtood the deliberations of her companion, and <hi>Stelle</hi> neuer found euill in what<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Aminthe</hi> willed. In this ſort they liued with ſuch priuacy, that there was nothing hidden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. But at laſt, <hi>Liſis,</hi> the ſonne of ſhepheard <hi>Genetian,</hi> leauing the froſty places of <hi>Mount-Lune,</hi> deſcended into our plaines, where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſeen her in a general aſſembly, which was had at the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple of <hi>Venus,</hi> iuſt ouer-againſt <hi>Mount-Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:177519:79"/>
meſſages, their affections were ſo forward, that <hi>Liſis</hi> beganne to talke of marriage, where to ſhee made as good an anſwer as he could deſire. In this ſpace <hi>Saliam</hi> was conſtrained to make a long iourney, ſo that hee knew nothing of this treaty: beſides that, ſhee had now taken ſo great authority ouer herſelfe, that ſhe would impart none of her affairs to him. On the other ſide, <hi>Aminthe</hi> ſeeing her ſo ſoon reſolued on this marriage, many times asked her, if it were in good earneſt, and it ſeemed fit, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of ſo great importance, to be well aduiſed. Trouble not your ſelfe, ſaid ſhe, I will eaſily diſpatch this buſineſſe. Hereupon <hi>Liſis,</hi> who ſerued with great eagerneſſe, ſet downe a day aſſigned, to make the aſſembly, and put himſelfe to the expences vſuall in ſuch occaſions, holding his marriage moſt aſſured: but the accuſtomed humour of many women, to make no man maſter of their liberty, letted her from going on with her former purpoſe, which ſhee endeuoured to breake, by demands moſt vnreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſhee thought the parents and friends of <hi>Liſis</hi> would neuer giue their conſent. But the loue which he bare her, being ſtronger then all difficulties, ſhe was (in the end) conſtrained to breake it, without other cloke, then the ſmalneſſe of her good will. If <hi>Liſis</hi> were offended, you may iudge, receiuing ſo great a wrong: yet could he not driue away this loue, but he would be the conquerour. And, I remember, that vpon this diſcourſe he made theſe verſes, which ſince (when we were friends) hee gaue me.</p>

                  <p>That which cauſed this change in <hi>Stelle,</hi> was a new affection, which the wrong of a ſhepheard called <hi>Semire,</hi> bred in her ſoule, whereof <hi>Liſis</hi> was the laſt that knew it, becauſe ſhe kept it rather from him then any other. This ſhepheard, amongſt all the men that euer I ſawe, is the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembler, and moſt crafty, otherwiſe an honeſt man, and a perſon that had many louely parts in him, which gaue occaſion to this ſhepheardeſſe to refuſe (contrary to promiſe) the alliance of <hi>Liſis,</hi> ſetting that in place of a fauour to her new louer, who yet triumphed not long in this victorie. For it fell out, that <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, Liſis</hi> and <hi>Stelle</hi> were called thither: and becauſe wee were neere of kinne, <hi>Olympe</hi> and I, I would not fayle to be there. I know not if it were the reuenge of loue, or the inconſtant nature of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe, by her vncertaine carriage, brought it about where ſhe was party: ſo it was, that as ſoone as ſhe ſawe <hi>Liſis</hi> againe, ſhe tooke a fancie to recall him: and to effect it, forgot none of thoſe allurements, wherein Nature had beene vnwiſely prodigall vnto her. The diſpleaſed courage of the ſhepheard gaue him armour enough, not to loue her, but onely to hide his affection.</p>
                  <p>In the end, towards euening, that euery one is buſied, either in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or in entertaining the perſon he likes beſt of, ſhe followed him in ſuch ſort, that thruſting him againſt a window, from which he could not honeſtly eſcape, he was conſtrayned to ſuſtaine the forces of his enemie. On the other ſide, <hi>Semire,</hi> who had alwayes his eye on her, hauing marked the purſuites that ſhe made all that euening to this ſhepheard, following the nature of euery louer, beganne to let ſome iealouſie breed in his ſoule, knowing well, that the Candle lately put out, will eaſily be lighted againe; and ſeeing that ſhe had ſhoued him vp againſt the window, that he might heare what ſhe ſayd to him; making ſhew of talking with ſome other, he came ſo neere her, that he heard her aske him, why he did fly from her ſo mainely. Truely (ſayd <hi>Liſis)</hi> this is a ſtrange kinde of purſuing me, and with too brazen a brow. But though I know (ſayd <hi>Stelle)</hi> whence theſe iniuries grow, it may be, that hearing me, and iudging without paſſion, all the wrong will not lie on that ſide you thinke. For Gods ſake (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Liſis)</hi> ſhepheardeſſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

from your fickleneſſe, which makes it iuſtifiable, that may it pleaſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, that he that hath done all the wrong, may likewiſe feele all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. But let vs treade all theſe things vnder foote, and loſe you as well the memory, as I haue loſt the will to loue you. I vnderſtand (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Stelle)</hi> whence your anger growes; and indeede you haue reaſon to carry your ſelfe in this maner. Behold, I beſeech you, the great wrong which is done, not to take one for an husband, as ſoone as he is tendered. Is it not the cuſtome, alwayes to make a demand twice? Indeed, if I had not taken you at a word, I had done you great wrong. But how apparent is it to refuſe a man ſo conſtant, that had loued me but three moneths? <hi>Liſis</hi> ſeeing before his ey<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, that which her outrage would not ſuffer him to loue, and which his loue would not permit him to hate, knew not with what words to anſwer her: yet to interrupt this torrent of words, he ſaid, <hi>Stelle,</hi> it is ſufficient we haue long ſince proued, that you do know better what to ſay, then to do, and that words flow higheſt in your mouth, when reaſon in you is at the loweſt ebbe. But, hold that which I tell you for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiolable; as much as I haue heeretofore loued you, ſo much at this houre do I hate you: and there ſhall neuer be day of my life, that I will not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime you for the moſt vngratefull and deceitfull woman that is vnder heauen.</p>
                  <p>At this word, offering violence to his affection, and the arme of <hi>Stelle,</hi> wherewith ſhe leaned on the wall, to keepe him in againſt the window, he left her alone, and went amongſt the other ſhepheards, that (for that time) warranted him againſt his enemy. <hi>Semire</hi> (as I told you) heard all this diſcourſe, and remayned ſo aſtonied, and ſo ill ſatisfied with her, that from that time, he reſolued neuer to make account of a ſpirit ſo flitting. And that which yet gaue him more will, was, that by chance, hauing long ſought occaſion to ſpeake to her; and ſeeing <hi>Liſis</hi> had left her alone, I went to her: for I muſt confeſſe, that her allurements and trickes had more force in my ſoule, then the wrong ſhe had done to <hi>Liſis:</hi> had giuen me knowledge of the imperfection of her ſpirit; and as euery man goes flattering his deſires, I went fancying, ſo that that which the merits of <hi>Liſis</hi> could not obtaine of her, my good fortune might procure me. So that, ſo long as his wooing laſted, I would neuer let my affection appeare; for beſides the kindred that was betweene him and me, there was a very ſtrait amity: but when I ſawe that he went off, thinking the place to be voyd (I neuer tooke heed to the ſuite of <hi>Semire).</hi> I thought it to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſcouer ſomwhat to her, rather then to attend till ſhe had another deſſigne. So then, addreſſing my ſelfe to her, and ſeeing her very penſiue, I
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:177519:80"/>
ſayd, It muſt needes be ſome great occaſion which made her ſo changed, for this ſadneſſe was not vſuall to her quicke humour. It is the rage of <hi>Liſis</hi> (anſwered ſhe) that will alwayes remember the time paſſed, and walkes reproching me, for the refuſall I made of him. And that, ſaid I, ſhall it grieue you? It cannot be otherwiſe, anſwered ſhe, for we cannot put off our affection, as we may our ſmocke. And he takes in ſo euill part my delay, that he alwayes calleth it a farewell. Truly (ſayd I) <hi>Liſis</hi> deſerues not the honour of your good graces, ſince that, not being able to winne them by his merits, he ought at leaſt to endeuour it by his long ſeruices, accompanyed with a ſtrong patience; but his boyling humour, and it may be, his little loue will not ſuffer him. If this good lucke might befall me, with what affection would I receiue it, and with what patience would I attend it? Father, it may be, you will thinke it ſtrange, to heare mee tell you the ſudden change of this ſhepheardeſſe; and yet I ſweare vnto you, that ſhe receiued the ouerture of my loue, ſo ſoone as I made it; and ſo, that before wee parted, ſhee liked well of my offer of the ſeruice which I made her, and gaue me leaue to call my ſelfe her ſeruant. You may well thinke, that <hi>Semire,</hi> who was liſtening, remayned no more ſatisfied with me, then he had beene with <hi>Liſis,</hi> and indeede from that time hee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew his ſuite; yet ſo diſcreetly, that many thought <hi>Stelle</hi> had beene the cauſe by her refuſall: For ſhe made no ſhew of grieuing much at it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the place of his loue was filled with a new deſſigne which ſhe had in me, which was the cauſe that I receiued more fauours from her then other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhould. Which <hi>Liſis</hi> ſoone perceiued. But loue, which will alwayes triumphs ouer friendſhip, with-held me from ſpeaking to him, fearing to diſpleaſe the ſhepheardeſſe; and though hee were very angry that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from him, yet ſhould I neuer haue ſpoken to him of it, without the permiſſion of <hi>Stelle,</hi> who made ſhew to deſire that this buſineſſe might paſſe by his hands. And ſince (as I haue noted) ſhe did it with a purpoſe to reimbarke him once againe with her. But I, who then tooke no heede to all her trickes, and who ſought after nothing but the meanes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent her; one night when <hi>Liſis</hi> and I lay together, I vſed this language to him, I muſt confeſſe <hi>(Liſis,)</hi> that at laſt Loue ſports himſelfe with me: and more, there is nothing can deferre my death, but that which ſhall come from you. From me (anſwered <hi>Liſis?)</hi> You may be aſſured that I will neuer be wanting to our friendſhip, though your miſtruſt hath made you commit as great an offence; and thinke not but I haue knowne your loue: but your ſilence, which diſpleaſed me, made me hold my peace. Since you (replied I) haue knowne it, and haue not ſpoken to me of it, I
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:177519:81"/>
haue the more cauſe of offence. For I confeſſe, I haue failed in ſome things againſt our friendſhip in my ſilence, but you muſt conſider, that a louer is not himſelfe, and in all his errours you are to accuſe the violence of his diſeaſe: but you that haue no paſſion, can haue no excuſe, but the want of friendſhip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Liſis</hi> beganne to laugh, when he heard my reaſons, and anſwered me: You are pleaſant, <hi>Corilas,</hi> to pay me with a demaund; yet will I neuer gaine-ſay you: and ſince you haue this opinion, ſee wherein I may amend this fault. In doing for me (anſwered I) which you could not for your ſelfe: that is, (I muſt tell you at laſt) that if I attayne not the loue of <hi>Stelle,</hi> there is no hope in me. O God, then cryed <hi>Liſis,</hi> to what paſſage hath your misfortune led you? Flie <hi>(Corilas)</hi> this dangerous ſea, where indeede there are nothing but rockes and bankes, marked with the ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracke of thoſe which haue taken the ſame courſe. I ſpeake out of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, as you know. I hope your merits may elſe-where gaine you a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fortune then me, but neither vertue nor reaſon can do it heere. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, It is no ſmall contentment to me, to heare you vſe this language: for till now I was in doubt you had yet ſome feeling, and that made me the more reſerued; but ſince (God be thanked) it is not ſo, I deſire in this loue to draw out an extreme proofe of your friendſhip. I know that the hatred which ſucceeds loue, meaſures it ſelfe after the greatneſſe of the fall, and hauing ſo dearely loued this fayre ſhepheardeſſe, comming to hate her, the hatred ſhould thereby be the greater: yet hauing knowne by <hi>Stelle</hi> her ſelfe, that I cannot come to that I deſire, but by your meanes, I adiure you by our friendſhip, to aſſiſt me, be it by perſwading her, be it by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating her, or in any ſort that may be; and I call it an extreme proofe. For, I doubt not, but that hating her, it will grieue you to ſpeake to her: but it is my amity, which deſires it might be manifeſted, that it is greater then your hatred. <hi>Liſis</hi> was ſurprized, expecting from mee another prayer then this, whereby, beſides the diſpleaſure which he had to ſpeake to <hi>Stelle,</hi> hee now ſawe himſelfe bereaued for euer of the perſon he loued moſt. Yet he anſwered, I ſhall do all that you will: you cannot promiſe more to your ſelfe of me, then I haue of good will: but bethinke you of what is paſſed betweene vs, and that I haue alwayes heard them ſay, that for meſſages of Loue, you muſt not ſerue your ſelfe of perſons that are hated. It is true, there is no neceſſity to looke on <hi>Stelle</hi> ſo neere, ſince I can aſſure you, you may as well diſpatch your buſineſſe of this kinde, as well as any other. Behold then, the poore <hi>Liſis,</hi> inſtead of a Louer, becomes meſſenger of loue, a myſtery which his friendſhip commaunded him to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:177519:81"/>
do for mee, not of his owne ſeeking, but with an intent to ſerue mee as a friend, though ſince (it may be) Loue cauſed him to change (in ſome ſort) his purpoſe, as I will tell you. But in this we muſt accuſe the violence of Loue, and the ouer-abſolute power he hath ouer man, and admire the friendſhip he bare mee, which ſuffered him to agree to the bereauing of himſelfe for euer of that which he loued, that I might poſſeſſe it.</p>
                  <p>Some dayes after, ſeeking occaſion to ſpeake with her, he found it ſo fitly to his purpoſe with her, that there was no body by, to interrupt their diſcourſe, ſo long as he pleaſed to make it; and then renewing the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the iniury he receiued, hee ſo armed himſelfe againſt her allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that Loue had ſmall hope hee could vanquiſh him at that bout: which was not, for that the ſhepheardeſſe ſtudyed not as much to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount him, as he did to find ſureties for his liberty: but becauſe he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed againſt loue, deſpite and friendſhip; the firſt armed with offence, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with duty, he remained vnconquered at that combat. Before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeake, ſhee ſeeing him to approach, went to meete him, with words of the ſame faſhion. What good lucke (ſayd ſhe) is that which brings me the much deſired <hi>Liſis?</hi> what vnhoped for fauor is this? I begin to haue good hope of my ſelfe, now you are come backe: for I may truely ſweare, that ſince you left me, I neuer found intire contentment. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhepheard anſwered, More affected, then faithfull ſhepherdeſſe, I am more ſatiſfied with the confeſſion you make, then I haue bene offended at your infidelity. But let vs leaue this diſcourſe, and forget it for euer, &amp; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere me to that I demaund. Are you yet reſolued to deceiue all them that loue you? For my part, I know well what to beleeue, none of your humors to my coſt being vnknowne to me: but that which I muſt demand of you, is to know at your ſhoppe, if a man may part at a better rate: for if you ſpeake with affection oth, or other ſort of aſſurance, that no man ſhall bee deceiued by you, for certaine they are of my ranke. The ſhepheardeſſe looked not for theſe reproches, notwithſtanding ſhee forbore not to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere him, If you come but to iniure me, I thanke you for this viſitation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you haue good occaſion to complaine of me. I complaine, (anſwered the ſhepheard?) I beſeech you ſet that aſide. I complaine no more then I do iniure you, and ſo far am I from vſing complaint, that I commend your humor: for if you ſhould longer make ſhew to loue mee, I ſhould liue the longer time in deceit: and did it pleaſe God, that the loſſe of your loue brought me no more griefe then dammage, you ſhould haue no cauſe to ſay, I complained, no more then I will iniure you, ſince iniury and truth can be no more together, then you and faithfulneſſe.

the moſt deceitfull and vngratefull ſhepheardeſſe of <hi>Foreſts.</hi> Me thinkes (anſwered <hi>Stelle)</hi> little courteous ſhepheard, this diſcourſe might better fit another mans mouth then yours.

She thinking that he mocked her, Let vs leaue this diſcourſe, ſaid ſhe; &amp; let it ſuffice, <hi>Liſis,</hi> that you haue loued me, being at this houre vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to renew the remembrance of your errour.

I haue told him that I haue prooued in you, the ſmall loue the little aſſurance that is in your ſoule, and in your words. I haue ſworne vnto him, that you will deceiue him, and I know you will not keepe me from being periured: but the poore miſerable is ſo intangled, that hee is of opinion, that what I could not attaine, his merits may reach to; and yet, to free him of deceit, I cold him, that the greateſt impediment to obtain any thing of you, is me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; and that you may credit that I tell you, ſee a letter which he hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to you. I make no queſtion but if hee haue failed, you will make him do penance. And becauſe <hi>Stelle</hi> would not read my letter, <hi>Liſis</hi> opening it, read it aloud.</p>

in; and after, how you may make him find your deniall more bitter. This ſpeech touched the ſhepheardeſſe in good earneſt, ſeeing how far hee was gone off from louing her; ſo that to interrupt him, ſhe was conſtrained to ſay, Me thinks, <hi>Liſis,</hi> that if <hi>Corilas</hi> be of the minde this paper makes ſhew of, he was ill aduiſed to employ you, ſince your words are more able to winne hatred then loue, and you ſeeme rather a meſſenger of war then peace. <hi>Stelle</hi> (replyed the ſhepheard) he was ſo farre from being ill adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this election, that if hee had ſhewed as much iudgement in the reſt of his actions, he ſhould not ſtand in ſo great neede of your ſuccours: he hath had tryall of your fancies; hee knowes what your allurements are; and of whom might hee better ſerue himſelfe, without ſuſpition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king himſelfe a competitor, then of a louing friend, ſuch as I am, whom you hate more then death? And yet the Arte wherewith I ſerue my ſelfe, is not bad: for repreſenting you ſo louely as you are, you may the better acknowledge the honor he doth you to loue you. But let vs leaue this talke, and tell me, in good earneſt, whether he be in your good grace, and how long hee ſhall continue; ſince, in truth, I dare not returne to him, without bringing him ſome good anſwer: I coniure you by his loue and ours paſſed. To this reaſon the ſhepheard added ſome others, with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prayers, that the ſhepheardeſſe beleeued hee ſpake in good earneſt; whereto ſhe eaſily perſwaded her ſelfe, according to her good nature: for it is the cuſtome of them that eaſily affect themſelues, to thinke that they are more eaſily affected. It was ſo, that for this time <hi>Liſis</hi> could obtaine of her nothing, but that the loue of his couſin for default of his owne, ſhould not be vnpleaſing to her; but Time ſhould be her counceller. And after, at diuers times hee ſollicited her, ſo that hee had what aſſurance he would: and becauſe he remembred her flitting humour, he laboured to bind her with a promiſe written with her owne hand, and knew ſo well to turne her on euery ſide, that he had what he would. He came backe in that ſort to me, and diſcourſed vnto me all that hee had done, except this promiſe; for knowing the humour of <hi>Stelle,</hi> he doubted alwaies that ſhee would deceiue him, and if he ſpake to me of that paper, I might be further engaged, and ſo more painefull to with-draw mee. All this was without the knowledge of <hi>Aminthe,</hi> from whom <hi>Stelle</hi> concealed it, rather then from any other. When I had receiued ſuch aſſurance of that which I moſt deſired, after I had thanked the ſhepheardeſſe, I beganne, with her permiſſion, to giue order for the marriage, and made no difficulty to ſpeake openly of it, though <hi>Liſis</hi> alwaies fore-told me, that in the end, I ſhould be deceiued: but the apparence of the good we deſire, ſo flatters
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:177519:83"/>
vs, that hardly giue we care to them that tell vs the contrary.</p>
                  <p>While this marriage was divulged, <hi>Semire,</hi> who, as I told you, had left his ſuite, by reaſon of <hi>Liſis</hi> and mee, beeing prouoked with a ſpeech which ſhee had vſed of him, reſolued (to make the contrary ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, at what price ſoeuer) to returne into her good graces, with a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to leaue her in the end, with that boldneſſe, that ſhe might neuer ſay more, that this ſeparation proceeded from her. There was no neede to vſe any great Arte, for her changing humour eaſily ſuffered her to returne to her nature: and ſo at a blow, behold her reſolue to forſake me for <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,</hi> as a little before ſhe had left <hi>Semire</hi> for me, yet was ſhee not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without paine, becauſe of the promiſe which ſhee had written, not knowing how to gaine-ſay it. In the end, the day of marriage beeing come, when I had aſſembled the moſt part of my kindred and friends, I held my ſelfe ſo aſſured, that I receiued the reioycings of al the world: but ſhe, that had another thought, while I was buſied in welco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming thoſe that were come, brake all this meeting, with excuſes more poorely grounded then the former; wherewith I was ſo enraged, that getting from her without bidding adieu, I conceiued ſo great diſdaine of her lightneſſe, that neuer ſince ſhee could cope with me.</p>
                  <p>Now iudge, father, if I haue cauſe to complaine of her, and, if they that tell it to my diſaduantage, were well informed. Indeed (anſwered <hi>Ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas)</hi> you may ſee a woman vnworthy of that name, and I wonder how it is poſſible that hauing deceiued ſo many, there ſhould be any that would truſt her. I haue not yet told you all (replied <hi>Corilas:)</hi> for after euery one was gone but <hi>Liſis,</hi> ſhee ſo wrought, that <hi>Semire</hi> ſtayed with her vntill euening. In the meane time, as I thinke, ſhe laboured to vſe ſome arte to haue her promiſe backe, becauſe ſhee ſaw well hee was throughly angry with her. In the end, very boldly ſhe ſpake to him thus: Is it poſſible, <hi>Liſis,</hi> that you haue ſo forgotten the affection which ſo often you haue ſworne to me, that you haue no minde to pleaſe me? I, ſayd <hi>Liſis,</hi> the heauens ſooner kill me.</p>
                  <p>At this word, what impediment ſoeuer ſhe vſed, hee got out of the houſe to be gone: but ſhe took ſuch hold on him, and taking his hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene hers, ſhe went with him, claſping in ſuch a faſhion, that euery one might iudge, that there was loue, and though he right well knew her hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and her deceits, yet could he not containe himſelfe from being plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with her ſlatteries, though he gaue no credit to them, which hee well witneſſed, when conſidering her actions, he ſaid, O God, <hi>Stelle,</hi> how doe you abuſe the graces, wherein the Heauens (without reaſon) haue beene
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:177519:83"/>
ſo prodigall to you? If this body did incloſe a ſpirit which had any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance with the beauty, who is hee that could reſiſt you? She, who knew what force her allurements had, placed all her arte in her eyes; all her fictions in her mouth; and all her malice in her inuention, wherewith ſhe ſo turned him on all ſides, that ſhe almoſt ſet him beſides himſelfe, &amp; then ſhe vſed theſe words: Gentle ſhepheard, if it bee true, that you bee that <hi>Liſis,</hi> which ſometimes haue ſo dearely affected me, I coniure you by the remembrance of the time ſo happy for me, that you will heare mee in priuate, and beleeue, that if you haue had any occaſion to complaine, I will make it plaine vnto you, that this ſecond fault, or at leaſt, as you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it ſo, was not committed but to remedy the former. At theſe words <hi>Liſis</hi> was ouercome; yet, that hee might not ſhew his weakeneſſe, he anſwered, See, <hi>Stelle,</hi> how farre you are gone from your opinion; ſo far am I from deſire to doe any thing that might pleaſe you, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſpleaſing, which I will not endeuour to do. Since there is no other remedy (anſwered the ſhepheardeſſe) come backe into the houſe to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe me. With this intent, anſwered he, I will. So then they went in: and as they ſtood by the fire, ſhe began to ſpeake thus: In the end (ſhepherd) it is impoſſible I ſhould longer liue with you and diſſemble: I muſt put off the maske to al my actions, and ſo you ſhal know, that poore <hi>Stelle,</hi> whom you haue accounted ſo ſlitting, is more conſtant then you imagine, and deſires onely that you ſhould know it, that for the ſatisfaction of the wrongs you haue done mee, you would freely confeſſe you haue wronged me. But (ſaid ſhee) (ſuddainely breaking off that ſpeech) what haue you done with the promiſe which you haue had of mee in the behalfe of <hi>Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las?</hi> for if you haue deliuered it him, that onely may breake off our affaires; who being in the place of <hi>Liſis,</hi> would not beleeue ſhee loued him, and would not be deceiued like him. This ſhepheard being of opinion, that ſhee would doe that for him for which ſhe refuſed me, without difficulty gaue her this promiſe, which hee had alwaies kept moſt charily and moſt ſecretly: as ſoone as ſhe had it, ſhe tore it, and going neere the fire, made it a ſacrifice: and then turning toward the ſhepheard, ſmiling, ſhee ſayd. There is no more for you to doe, gentle ſhepheard, but you may hold on your way, for it is ouer-late. O God, cried <hi>Liſis</hi> (finding her practices) Is it poſſible that the third time I ſhould be receiued by one perſon? And what cauſe haue you (ſaid <hi>Stelle)</hi> to ſay you are deceiued? Ah! perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſloyall (ſaid he) did you not come out to tel me, that you would make it plaine, that this laſt fault was to repaire the former, and to make proofe that you are conſtant, you layd open your naked heart and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:177519:84"/>
                     <hi>Liſis</hi> (ſaid ſhee) you come alwaies with your iniuries; if I neuer loued you, am I not conſtant, not to loue you now? And haue I not made you ſee what my heart is? and whereto tend my actions, but hauing that I would of you, I leaue you in peace? Beleeue, that all the words which you haue made me loſe for an houre together, was, but to recouer this paper; and now (ſince I haue it) I pray God to giue you the good night. What an amazement, thinke you, was the ſhepheard in? It was ſo great, that without ſpeech, or ſpending further time, halfe beſides himſelfe, hee went homeward: But certainely, he hath had ſince good occaſion to bee reuenged: For <hi>Semire,</hi> as I haue told you, which was the cauſe of my euill, or rather of my good, ſo I may cal that ſeparation of amity, feeling in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe yet the diſpleaſure of the firſt diſgrace which ſhe had done him, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this extreme leuity, and conſidering that (it might be) ſhe might ſerue him ſo, he reſolued to preuent it: and ſo hauing abuſed her, as we were <hi>(Liſis</hi> and I) he broke the treaty of marriage, in the middeſt of an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, which he had purpoſely cauſed to be made, which procured many to ſay, that by the ſame weapon whereby a wound is giuen, oftentimes the puniſhment is receiued.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Corilas</hi> ended in this ſort; and <hi>Adamas</hi> ſmiling, ſaid, My child, the beſt counſell that I can giue you herein, is, to ſhun the familiarity of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, and to keep your ſelfe from her practices, and to giue contentment to your parents, that with great impaciency deſire to ſee you married, and when any good proffer is offered, receiue it, and ſtay not on theſe youthful tricks of Loue: for there is nothing that can better warrant you from the plots and ſurprizes of this deceiuer, nor which will make you more eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med among your neighbours, then to marry, not ſo much by Loue, as by reaſon; it beeing one of the moſt important actions that you can euer doe, and wherein all the happineſſe or misfortune of a man may depend.

She might bee glad of this meeting; for by fortune they were come out of their Hamlet, with a purpoſe to paſſe the reſt of the day together; and the better to ſpend the time, they had a meaning there ſhould be no more then they three, that they might more freely ſpeake of their greateſt ſecrets; ſo that <hi>Leonide</hi> could not haue come in a better time to ſatisfie her curioſity; eſpecially, ſince they were but newly come.

And ſince it pleaſeth you, that at laſt I ſhall renew that grieuous remembrance, ſuffer me to abridge it, that I may (in ſome ſort) leſſen the happineſſe, wherein I am by the memory of paſſed troubles. I aſſure my ſelfe, that though you neuer ſawe <hi>Celion</hi> and <hi>Belinde,</hi> yet you haue heard they were my father and mother; and (it may be) haue knowne the croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which they had for the loue of the one to the other, which lets mee from telling them, though they were preſages of thoſe I met with. But you muſt know, that after the cares of loue were ended in marriage, that they might not remayne ydle, ſuites of law and ſundry troubles beganne to grow, and ſo plentifully, that wearied with charge of proceſſe, to make an accord, many, among the reſt, a neighbour of theirs named <hi>Phormion,</hi> trauayled ſo, that their friends were of aduice at laſt, that to end all ſuits, they ſhould giue ſome promiſes of future alliance betweene them: and becauſe neither the one nor the other, as yet, had any children, as hauing

not beene long married, they ſwore by <hi>Theurales</hi> on the Altar of <hi>Belenus,</hi> that if they both had but one ſonne, and one daughter, they ſhould marry together; and ratified this alliance with ſo many oathes, that hee which brake them, ſhould be the moſt periured creature in the world. Some time after, my father had a ſonne, which was loſt, when the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Oſtrogots</hi> ranſacked this prouince.

Beſides that, ſhee was not ignorant, that when ſhe ſhould diſcouer her ſelfe to be a maide, ſhe ſhould giue no ſmall cauſe of talke to all the country. Theſe reaſons made her continue the name which ſhe had during her fathers life: and fearing now more then euer, that ſome one might diſcouer what ſhe was, ſhe held me ſo ſtrait, that I was ſeldome without her. But (faire ſhepheardeſſes) ſince it pleaſeth you to know my young paſſages, you muſt, when you heare them, excuſe them; and withall, haue this beliefe of me, that I haue had ſo many and ſo great troubles for louing, that I am no more ſenſible on that ſide, hauing beene ſo hardened, that loue hath, neyther ſo ſtrong, nor ſo ſharpe armes, that he can pier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

But the heauens, which knew our pure

and cleane intents, would fauour vs from that good houte. The firſt time that I ſawe him, was on the day we celebrate to <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Diane,</hi> when he came to the game with a ſiſter whom he reſembled ſo much, that they held on them the eyes of the greateſt part of the aſſembly. And becauſe ſhe was neere of kinne to my deare <hi>Daphnis,</hi> as ſoone as I ſawe her, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced her, and I welcomed her with a face ſo open, that from that time ſhe thought her ſelfe bound to loue me: her name was <hi>Callyre,</hi> and was married on the coaſt of <hi>Furan,</hi> to a ſhepheard called <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> whom ſhe had neuer ſeene vntill the day whereon ſhe was married, which was the cauſe of the little loue ſhe bare him. The entertainement which I vſed to the ſiſter, gaue occaſion to the brother to tarry by me ſo long as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice laſted; and by fortune, I know not whether I ſhould call it good or euill for him: I ſet out my ſelfe that day as well as I could, thinking (by reaſon of my name) that this feaſt concerned me more particularly then others.</p>
                  <p>He that comming from far, had no other knowledge of the ſhepheards nor ſhepheardeſſes, then that which his ſiſter gaue him, for ſooke vs not all that day, ſo that in ſome ſort, thinking my ſelfe bound to entertaine him, I did what I could to pleaſe him, and my labour was not vnprofitable: for from that time this poore ſhepheard gaue birth to an affection, which neuer ended but with his death. And euen yet I am aſſured, that if in the graue they haue any remembrance of the liuing, hee loues me; and in the very aſhes conſerues the pure affection hee ſwore to me. <hi>Daphnis</hi> tooke note both of the day and the deed, being that night in bed (becauſe that <hi>Filidas</hi> not being well, could not come to the games) ſhe told me it; but I reiected this conceit ſo long, that ſhe ſaid, I ſee wall <hi>(Diane)</hi> that this day wil coſt me many prayers, and <hi>Filander</hi> much paine: but howſoeuer it happen, you ſhall not be quite exempted. She vſed to warre on me with ſuch aſſaults, becauſe ſhe perceiued I feard them; this was the cauſe that I ſtayed not to giue her anſwer.

Loue made him ſo cunning and wiſe, that holding on his deſigne, hee deceiued not onely <hi>Amidor,</hi> but my eyes alſo; becauſe that vſually hee would leaue vs to goe to him, and he would neuer come but in his company. It is true, that the crafty <hi>Daphnis</hi> found it preſently; becauſe (ſaid ſhee) that <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> is not ſo louely, that he can draw ſo honeſt a ſhepheard as <hi>Filander,</hi> to vſe ſo carefull a ſearch; ſo that it muſt needes be for a more worthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect.</p>
                  <p>She was the cauſe that I began to haue a care of my ſelfe: and I muſt confeſſe, that then his diſcretion pleaſed me; and if I could haue ſuffred my ſelfe to be beloued, it ſhould be of him: but the houre was not then come, that I ſhould bee ſtrucke on that ſide; yet did I not forbeare to pleaſe my ſelfe with his actions, and to approue his deſigne in ſome ſort. When hee was to take his leaue of vs, hee accompanied vs a good way; and at our parting, I neuer heard ſuch aſſurance of amity as he gaue to <hi>Amidor,</hi> nor ſo many offers of ſeruices, as to <hi>Filidas:</hi> and the foole <hi>Daphnis,</hi> vnhappy, whiſpered in mine care, Conceaue you that it is to you that he ſpeakes; and if you doe not anſwer him, you doe great wrong. And when <hi>Amidor</hi> beganne to thanke him, ſhe ſaid, Oh what a foole he is to beleeue, that theſe offerings are ordained for his Altar! but he could ſo well diſſemble, that hee made <hi>Amidor</hi> wholly his, and got ſuch ground on his good will, that when he returned, and was to deliuer that which <hi>Filander</hi> had on his part deſired him to ſay to <hi>Filidas,</hi> that this maid had a deſire to ſee him; and ſome dayes after, hee added ſo many ouer-laſhing commendations, not ſaying any thing to me of it (becauſe, that when I ſpake of him, it was with ſuch a coldneſſe, that it ſeemed to bee out of neglect) they ſent for him, deſiring him to come and ſee them: God knowes whether he neede bee ſollicited more then once, for it was the thing he deſired, thinking it was impoſſible that his deſigne ſhould haue a better beginning. And by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:177519:89"/>
fortune, the day that he was to come, <hi>Daphnis</hi> and I went out to walke vnder ſome trees, which are on the other ſide of that paſture that is next to this; &amp; ſcarce knowing to whom to go, while our flocks were feeding, we went, vncertaine whither our feete without election guided vs, when wee heard a voyce farre enough off, and wee thought it ſome ſtrangers. The deſire to know it, made vs turne directly to the place where the voice conducted vs, and by reaſon <hi>Daphnis</hi> went firſt, ſhe ſpied <hi>Filander</hi> before me, and made a ſigne to me to tread ſoftly: and when I came neer her, ſhe whiſpered in mine eare, naming <hi>Filander,</hi> who ſate leaning againſt a tree, entertaining his thoughts, wearied, as it ſeemed, with the length of his way, and by chance, iuſt as we came, he beganne in this ſort:</p>

At laſt, ſeeing I kept on my way, ſhe ſtole away from him by little and little, that ſhee might
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:177519:89"/>
not be heard, and at laſt ouertooke me; and being ſcarce able to take her breath, ſhe went crying out a thouſand broken reproches. And when ſhe could ſpeake, Vnfainedly, ſayes ſhe, if the heauens do not puniſh you, I ſhall beleeue they are as vniuſt as you: and, what cruelty is this of yours, not to heare him that complaynes? To what end (ſayd I) ſhould I haue ſtayed longer? To heare (ſayd ſhe) the euill you haue done him. I? (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I) You ieſt, in ſaying, that I doe hurt the man that I thinke not of. That is (replyed ſhe) whereof you labour moſt: for if you thought often of him, it were impoſſible but you ſhould haue pitty. I bluſhed at that word, and the change of colour gaue <hi>Daphnis</hi> to vnderſtand, that theſe words offended me. This was the cauſe that ſmiling ſhe ſayd: I am plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant <hi>(Diane:)</hi> that I ſaid, was but to paſſe the time away: and beleeue not that I thinke it: and concerning that he ſung when he named your name, it is for certaine, that it was for another that bare your name, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh himſelfe, he ſung theſe verſes, which he had receiued of ſome other. We went diſcourſing in this ſort; and ſo long, that being weary of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we came backe another way, to the ſame place where <hi>Filander</hi> was: For my part it was by errour: it may well be, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> did it of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and finding him ſo neere vs, I could not chooſe but looke on him: at the firſt he was ſitting, and leaned againſt a tree: but now wee found him layd all along on the ground, one arme vnder his head, and it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med he was awake, for he had a Letter all be-wet with teares, which ran downe his face; but indeed he ſlept, being likely, that while he read the paper, the trauell of the way, and his deepe thoughts, by little and little, made him ſlumber. But wee were more certayne, when <hi>Daphnis</hi> more bold then I, ſtowped downe, reached mee the Letter (wet with teares) which found paſſage thorow the paper badly folded: This ſight touched me with pitty, but much more the Letter, which was thus:</p>

                  <p>I had ſcarcely read ouer this Letter, but that I found my ſelfe all on a trembling, and <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſo ſoftly layd it in the place where ſhe found it, that he awaked not: and comming towards me, and I being hard by, Will you ſuffer me to ſpeake (ſayd ſhe?) Our loue (anſwered I) giues you all power. In truth (ſayd ſhe) I bewaile <hi>Filander,</hi> for it is very true hee loues you: and I perſwade my ſelfe, in your ſoule you doubt not of it. <hi>Daphnis</hi> (ſaid I) he that committed the fault, muſt do the penance. If it be ſo (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe) <hi>Filander</hi> muſt not: for I will neuer confeſſe it to be a fault, to loue you, but thinke rather it is an offence, not to do it, ſince the faireſt things had not bene made but to be beloued and cheriſhed. I referre my ſelfe to your iudgement (ſayd I) if my face may be numbred amongſt the things that are fayre. But I coniure you onely by our loue, neuer to let him know, that I take any notice of his intent. And if you loue him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe him, not to ſpeake to me: for eſteeming of you and <hi>Callire,</hi> as I doe, I am ſorry that I muſt baniſh him from our company: And you know wel I ſhall be conſtrained ſo to doe, if he haue the hardineſſe to ſpeake to me of it. Then, how will you haue him liue (ſayd ſhe?) As he liued (ſaid I) before he ſawe me. But (ſaid ſhe) that he cannot do heereafter, for that then he was not attached with this fire which now burnes him. Let him ſeeke out the meanes himſelfe, without offending me, by remoouing this fire. The fire (ſayd ſhe) that can be quenched, is not great, and yours is extreme. The fire (ſaid I) how great ſoeuer it be, will not burne him that comes not neere it. Though (ſayd ſhe) he that is burnt, flie from the fire, yet will not the burning leaue him, and by flying, he brings more ſmart, For concluſion (ſayd I) if it be ſo, I chooſe rather to be the fire then the burning.</p>
                  <p>With ſuch diſcourſes we returned to our flockes, and towards night we droue them into our Hamlet, where we found <hi>Filander,</hi> to whom <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas</hi> made ſo good cheere, and <hi>Amidor</hi> alſo, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> beleeued hee had bewitched them, it not being their humour to deale ſo with others. He ſtayed ſome dayes with vs, during which time hee made no offer of ſpeech, liuing with ſo great diſcretion, that, but for that which <hi>Daphnis</hi> and I had ſeene, we ſhould neuer haue ſuſpected his meaning. At laſt, hee was couſtrayned to depart, and not knowing to whom to breake it, hee went to his ſiſter, becauſe he loued her, and truſted her as himſelfe. This
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:177519:90"/>
ſhepheardeſſe (as I told you) had beene conſtrained by authority to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and found no other contentment, but that which the loue which ſhee bare her brother might giue her. As ſoone as ſhe ſawe him, ſhe was cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious after the firſt ſalutations, to know what the cauſe of his iourney was: and he hauing anſwered her, that he came from <hi>Filidas:</hi> ſhee demaunded what newes of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and me. Whereto hauing giuen ſatisfaction, and hearing him ſpeake with ſo great commendations of me; ſhe told him in his eare: I feare (brother) you loue him more then me. I loue her (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he) as her merit binds me. If it be ſo (replied ſhe) I haue diuined well: for there is not a ſhepheardeſſe in the world that deſerues better; &amp; I muſt confeſſe vnto you, that were I a man, would ſhee, or would ſhee not, I would be her ſeruant. I beleeue, ſiſter (anſwered he) you ſpeake in good earneſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſweare vnto you, (ſayd ſhe) by that which I hold moſt deare. I thinke (replyed he) if it were ſo, you ſhould not be without buſineſſe; for by that that I can iudge, ſhee is of an humour that is not eaſie to bend: beſides that, <hi>Filidas</hi> is ready to die of iealouſie, and <hi>Amidor</hi> ſo watches her, that ſhe is neuer without one of them two. O brother, cryed ſhe, you are taken: ſince you haue noted theſe particularities, hide it no longer from me: and without fiction, if it be a fault to loue, it is very pardonable. And without leauing him, ſhe ſo preſſed, that after a thouſand proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſo many ſupplications, neuer to be knowne of it, he confeſſed it to her, and with words ſo affectionate, that ſhe had beene very incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, if ſhe had doubted it. And when ſhe asked of him, how I receiued the declaration: O God (ſayd he!) if you knew what her humour is, you would ſay, that neuer man enterpriſed a more difficult attempt. All that I could do till now, was to deceiue <hi>Filidas</hi> and <hi>Amidor,</hi> that made me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue there is nothing in the world ſo deare to them as I; &amp; I am come to this, that they ſent for me, purpoſely to ſee me, and then told her all the diſcourſe, which had paſſed betweene them. But, ſaid he, holding on his ſpeech, though I went with a purpoſe to diſcouer to <hi>Diane,</hi> how much I was hers, yet durſt I not, (reſpect had ſuch force ouerme,) which made me deſpaire euer to performe it, vnleſſe ſome long practice gaue me the boldneſſe; but this cannot be, but that <hi>Filidas</hi> and <hi>Amidor</hi> will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it: So that (ſiſter) to tell you the eſtate wherein I am, it is very neere to deſpaire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Callire</hi> that loued her brother more then any other thing, took his griefe ſo to heart, that, after ſhe had thought of it a while, ſhe ſaid, Will you, brother, that in this occaſion I giue you ſome proofe of my good will?
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:177519:91"/>
Siſter (anſwered hee) though I be in no doubt, yet heyther in this, nor any other accident will I refuſe you euer. For the apparances of that we deſire, will not ſuffer vs to pleaſe our ſelfe, though from elſe-where we haue ſufficient aſſurance. Well, brother, ſince your will is ſo, I will do that for you, which ſhall not be ſmall, what hazard ſoeuer I thruſt my ſelfe into. And then ſhe went on: You know the likeneſſe of our faces, of our ſtature and ſpeech; and but for our habit, they that are ordinarily with vs, would take vs the one for the other. If you thinke the onely meane to come to your purpoſe, is to conuerſe with <hi>Diane</hi> without ſuſpition, how can wee finde one more eaſie, or more ſecret, then to change habits, you and I? For, being taken for a mayde, <hi>Filidas</hi> will neuer conceiue euil opinion, how neere ſoeuer you come to <hi>Diane:</hi> and I returning to <hi>Gere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan</hi> in your habit, will tell him, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Diane</hi> keep you there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Indeed, ſiſter (anſwered <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> I neuer doubted of your good nature; but at this time I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe, there was neuer a better ſiſter: and ſince it pleaſeth you to take this paine, I beſeech you, if I enioy her, to accuſe my loue which conſtrained it, and to beleeue that it is the only meane to conſerue the life of that bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whom you loue. And then he embraced her with ſo great an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the obligation which hee hath had, that ſhee became more deſirous to pleaſure him then before.</p>
                  <p>At laſt ſhe ſayd, let vs leaue theſe words to thoſe that loue leſſe, and let vs onely looke to ſet our hand to the worke. For leaue (ſayd he) wee ſhall eaſily get it, diſſembling that all the good cheere which was made mee by <hi>Filidas,</hi> was to no other purpoſe, then that <hi>Amidor</hi> had to woo the niece of your husband. And becauſe this charge will trouble him, I aſſure my ſelfe, it will be eaſie for you to goe, if we giue him to know, that you and <hi>Daphnis</hi> together may well treate of this marriage. But what order ſhall wee take for our haire, yours being long, and mine ouer-ſhort, which will be a great inconuenience? Trouble not your ſelfe for that (ſaid ſhe:) if you ſuffer yours to grow a little, it will be enough to ſerue vnder a coife, as I vſe; and for mine, I will cut them like yours. But, ſaid hee, Siſter, will you not be loth to clip your head? Brother (ſaid ſhe) think not, I hold any thing dearer then your contentment; beſides that, I ſhall auoyd many importunities while you weare my clothes, and not lying neere <hi>Gereſtan;</hi> ſo that if I muſt haue my head ſhorne, I will not make difficulty to doe it. With this word he embraced her, ſaying, that God would one
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:177519:91"/>
day deliuer him of that torment. And not to loſe time, <hi>Filander</hi> on the firſt occaſion that he thought fit, ſpake with <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> repreſenting to him that alliance ſo eaſily to be compaſſed, and ſo profitable, that hee will ſuffer himſelfe eaſily to be led. But, becauſe <hi>Filander</hi> would giue time to let his haire grow, he made ſhew to goe to giue order to his affayres, and that hee would returne very ſhortly. And <hi>Filidas</hi> no ſooner knew of <hi>Filanders</hi> returne, but ſhe went to ſee him, accompanied onely with <hi>Amidor,</hi> and would not leaue him, without bringing him to vs, where he ſtayed ſeuen or eight dayes, not hauing the hardineſſe to ſhew himſelfe to mee more then at the firſt.</p>
                  <p>During this time, to ſhew how hard a thing it is to force nature long, though <hi>Filidas</hi> counterfeited the man as well as ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>e could, yet was ſhee conſtrained to feele the paſſions of a woman; for the courage and merits of <hi>Filander</hi> wrought the ſame effect in her, that he deſired they ſhould in me. But Loue, which takes delight to turne the actions of the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, contrary to their purpoſe, made him giue the blow on the ſide he leaſt looked for: So behold the poore <hi>Filidas,</hi> ſo farre beſides her ſelfe, that ſhe could not liue without <hi>Filander,</hi> and wooed him with ſuch appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſhewes, that he was aſtoniſhed at it; and, but for the deſire he had to be neere me, he would neuer haue endured that faſhion of life. In the end, when he thought his hayre was long enough to put vnder a coife, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> and told him he had made a good entrance to their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe: but that <hi>Daphnis</hi> thought fit, before ſhe ſpake, that <hi>Amidor</hi> might ſee his neece in ſome place, that they might know if ſhe pleaſed him: and that the better way was, that <hi>Callire</hi> ſhould bring her, that ſo there might be a beginning of amity, that could not chooſe but be auaylable. <hi>Gere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtan,</hi> which deſired nothing with more paſſion, then to be diſcharged of his Niece, thought this propoſition very good, &amp; gaue abſolute co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement to his wife; who to egge him on the better, made ſhew of not liking it well at the firſt, propounding ſome difficulty in the iourney, and ſeeming to be ſorry to depart from him, ſaying, that ſhee knew well, that ſuch affairs wold not fal out as we would, nor ſo readily as was expected; and that in the mean time, their affaires would ſpeed the worſe at home. But <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> that would not haue her haue any other will then his, was ſo earneſt, that three dayes after, he cauſed her to goe with her brother and his Niece. The firſt day ſhe went to lodge at <hi>Filanders</hi> houſe, where in the morning they changed habit, which fell out ſo well for the one and the other, that they which conuerſed with them, knew it not: and I muſt tell you, I was deceiued as well as others, there being no difference betweene
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:177519:92"/>
them, that I could obſerue. But I may eaſily be deceiued, ſince <hi>Filidas</hi> was ſo, though ſhee looked but with the eyes of Loue, which are ſaid to bee more piercing then thoſe of Linxe's: For, preſently after their comming, they left vs the fained <hi>Callire,</hi> I would ſay <hi>Filander,</hi> and led the true into a chamber to reſt in. As they were in the way, her brother inſtructed her what to anſwer; and eſpecially, informed her of the Loue-tricks ſhee ſhould vſe, reſembling (ſaid hee) thoſe that are in loue; whereby, both the one and the other were offended: and, though <hi>Callire</hi> were fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to beare all his importunities, for the contentment of her brother; yet ſo it was, that ſhee, thinking <hi>Filidas</hi> to bee a man, that it was no ſmall horror to her, that ſhe was conſtrained to ſpeake to him. As for vs, when we were withdrawn alone, <hi>Daphnis</hi> &amp; I did all the kindneſſes that are v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall among women, I meane, among thoſe where there is Loue and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacy, which this ſhepheard tooke and gaue with that tranſport, that, as hee ſince ſwore, hee was quite beſide himſelfe. If I had not beene a very child, it may be, his actions might haue made me know him, &amp; yet <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis</hi> made no queſtion, he knew ſo well to counterfeit. And becauſe it was late, after ſupper wee withdrew apart, whilſt <hi>Callire</hi> and <hi>Filidas</hi> walked vp and downe the chamber: for my part, I knew not their diſcourſe, but ours grew onely from aſſurances of Loue, which <hi>Filander</hi> vſed to me, out of ſo intire affection, that it was eaſie to iudge, that if ſo often, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other habit, he ſayd nothing to me, wee muſt not blame his want of will, but of boldneſſe onely. And I likewiſe made the ſame ſhew to him: for taking him for a woman, I thought my ſelfe bound for his good will, for his merit, and for the kindred betweene her and <hi>Daphnis.</hi> From that time <hi>Amidor,</hi> that formerly had borne mee good will, beganne to change his loue, and to loue the fained <hi>Callire,</hi> for that <hi>Filander,</hi> who feared leſt his abode might diſpleaſe that young man, did what hee could to giue him contentment. The flitting humour of <hi>Amidor,</hi> could not permit him to receiue theſe fauours, without becomming amorous: which I thought not ſtrange, for that the beauty, the iudgement, and the curioſity of the ſhepheard, which in nothing belied the perfections of a mayd, had giuen him ouer-great cauſe.</p>
                  <p>See what a foole Loue is, and how he paſſeth his time, <hi>Filidas!</hi> that is a mayd, he cauſed to fall in loue with a mayd, and <hi>Amidor</hi> a man; and that in ſuch paſſion, that for one particular, that onely ſubiect was ſufficient to entertaine vs. God knowes if <hi>Filander</hi> knew how to play the mayd, and if <hi>Callire</hi> counterfeited well her brother, and whether they wanted wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to draw on either his new Louer. The coldneſſe that <hi>Callire</hi> vſed
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:177519:92"/>
to mee, was cauſe that <hi>Filidas</hi> had no iot of ſuſpition; beſides, that his loue was a ſufficient hinderance. And I muſt confeſſe, that ſeeing her ſo ſtrongly to draw towards <hi>Filidas, Daphnis</hi> &amp; I were of opinion, that <hi>Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> had changed his mind; whereupon I receiued extreme contentment, for the loue I bare his ſiſter. Seuen or eight dayes paſſed in this ſort, no one thinking the time too long, becauſe euery one had a particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figne. But <hi>Callire,</hi> who feared, her husband might be grieued at this ſtay, ſollicited her brother, to make his purpoſe knowne to mee, ſaying, there was no likelihood, but that the familiarity betweene him and mee, might haue permitted mee to haue refuſed his ſeruice: but hee aſſaying on all ſides, had neuer the hardineſſe to diſcouer himſelfe, and to abuſe <hi>Gereſtan.</hi> He deſired her to goe to her husband in the habit which ſhe had, aſſuring her, hee would finde out nothing; and to let him know, that by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſhee had left <hi>Callire</hi> at <hi>Filidas</hi> houſe, that at more leaſure, ſhe might treate of the marriage of <hi>Amidor</hi> and his Niece. At the firſt his ſiſter was aſtoniſhed, for her husband was very froward. At laſt, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to giue all contentment to her brother, ſhee reſolued; and to make this excuſe ſeeme more probable, they ſpake with <hi>Daphnis</hi> about the marriage of <hi>Amidor,</hi> which ſhe long time miſliked, for many conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſhe layd before them: but knowing they tooke this courſe to get leaue from <hi>Gerestan,</hi> which otherwiſe they could neuer haue had, ſhe, that delighted in their company, acquainted me with it; and we were of opinion, that it was needfull to make ſhew, that this alliance might bee eaſily compaſſed: and on this reſolution, ſhe wrote to <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him to let his wife ſtay ſomewhile with vs, that our friendſhip might be a meane, that this allyance might finde the leſſe difficulty, and that ſhe beleeued all things ſhould be well ended.</p>
                  <p>With this reſolution, <hi>Callire</hi> ſo attyred, goes to finde out her husband, who being beguiled by the habit, tooke her for her brother, and receiued the excuſes for the ſtay of his wife, beeing well pleaſed ſhee ſhould ſtay there for that cauſe. Iudge, faire ſhepheardeſſes, if I might not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when her husband could not know her. So it was, that by this, the good will he bare me, ſo increaſed, that there was no other meane to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale it, whatſoeuer he could do, the conuerſation hauing that vertue with it, that it makes that which was loued, to be more beloued, and more ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted what is found euill. And acknowledging his owne weakeneſſe, hee aduiſed himſelfe to perſwade me, that though he were a woman, yet hee failed not to be in loue with me, with ſuch a paſſion, and more then if hee had beene a man; and ſpoke it ſo feelingly, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> that loued mee
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:177519:93"/>
dearely, ſayd, Vntill that time, ſhee neuer knew him: But that it was true, that ſhe likewiſe was in loue, which one might not thinke ſtrange, ſince <hi>Filidas,</hi> who was a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, in ſuch ſort loued <hi>Filander:</hi> &amp; the diſſembled <hi>Callire</hi> ſwore, that one of the moſt forcible occaſions which conſtrained her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to goe away, was the ſuite hee made to him, whereof they could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge mee ſo many reaſons, that iealouſie ſuffered my ſelfe to be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it was ſo, determining with my ſelfe, that there was nothing in it that imported me. Hauing then receiued this fiction, ſhe made no diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty to ſpeak freely to me of her paſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but yet like a woman: &amp; becauſe ſhe ſwore vnto me, that the ſame feeling, and the ſame paſſions that men haue for loue, were in her, and that it was a great ſolace to her, to expreſſe them often being alone, repreſent vnto mee her true affections; and euen <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who liked well of it, would ſometimes auow it.</p>
                  <p>Twelue or fifteene dayes paſſed thus, with ſuch pleaſure to <hi>Filander,</hi> that as he ſince ſwore to me, he neuerſpent more happy dayes, though his deſires gaue him extreme impaciencies, and that was the cauſe of the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly increaſe of his affection; and pleaſing himſelfe in his thoughts, hee would oftentimes withdraw himſelfe alone, to entertaine them: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would not remoue from vs in the day, many times in the night, when he thought euery body was aſleepe, he went out of his chamber, and entred into a garden, where vnder ſome trees he paſſed a great part of time in theſe his conſiderations; and for that many times he went out in this ſort, <hi>Daphnis</hi> obſerued it, who lay in the ſame chamber: and as commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly we ſooner ſuſpect euill then good, ſhe had ſome conceit of her, &amp; <hi>Amidor,</hi> for the kindneſſe which the yong ſhepheard did her; and for more certainty ſhe watched ſo, that ſeeming to ſleepe, ſhe perceiued the fayned <hi>Callyre</hi> to ſteale out of her bed, and followed her ſo cloſe, that ſhe was almoſt as ſoone in the vtter yard, as the young ſhepheard, caſting o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer her but one garment for haſte; and following her, ſtep by ſtep, by the light of the Moone, ſhe ſawe her goe out of the houſe thorow a doore not well locked, and enter into a garden, which was vnder my chamber window; and paſſing into the midſt of it, ſaw her ſit downe vnder ſome trees, and lifting his eyes vp to heauen, heard him ſay aloude:</p>

                     <lg>
                        <l>So my <hi>Diane</hi> doth ſurpaſſe</l>

Though <hi>Filander</hi> ſpake theſe words high enough, yet <hi>Daphnis</hi> heard but ſome of them, by reaſon ſhe was farre off; but taking it ſomewhat remote, ſhe drew toward him without being ſeene, as ſoftly as ſhe could, though he were ſo intentiue to his imagination, that had ſhe beene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he would not haue perceiued it, as he ſince ſwore to me. Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly had ſhe got neere him, but ſhe might heare him fetch a deepe ſigh, loud enough, and after with a lowe voyce ſay: And why will not my fortune haue me as fit to ſerue her, as ſhe is worthy to be ſerued? and why may not ſhe as well receiue the affections of them that loue her, as ſhee giue them extreme paſſions? Ah <hi>Callyre!</hi> how pernitious to my repoſe hath your diſguiſing beene, and my boldneſſe puniſhed with a right iuſt infli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daphnis</hi> heard <hi>Filander</hi> very attentiuely, and though he ſpake plaine, yet could ſhe not comprehend what he meant, abuſed by the opinion that he was <hi>Callyre:</hi> this was the cauſe, that bending an care more curiouſly, ſhe heard him lifting his voyce ſomewhat higher, ſay, But ouer-bold <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> who ſhall euer excuſe thy fault? or, what great chaſtiſement ſhall equall thine error? Thou loueſt this ſhepheardeſſe, and ſeeſt not, that how much her beauty commands, ſo much her vertue forbids thee: how often haue I warned thee, and yet thou wouldeſt not beleeue me? Accuſe none other of thine euill, but thine owne folly. At this word his tongue ſtayed, but his eyes and ſighes, in ſtead of it, beganne to giue teſtimony what her paſſion was, whereof he had diſcouered but a little. And to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert him from his thoughts, or rather, to continue them more ſweetly, he roſe vp to walke (as he vſed) and ſo ſuddenly, that he perceiued <hi>Daphnis,</hi> though to hide her ſelfe, ſhe fled away. But he that had ſeene her, to know who it was, purſued her to the entry of a very thicke wood, where he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertooke her; and thinking ſhe had diſcouered that which he had ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed, halfe in choler, ſayd: What curioſity <hi>(Daphnis)</hi> is this, to come and ſpie me out in the night heere? It is, anſwered <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſmiling, to learne of you (by craft) that which I ſhould not know otherwiſe (and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhe thought ſhe ſpake to <hi>Callyre,</hi> not hauing yet diſcouered that it was <hi>Filander.)</hi> Well (held on <hi>Filander)</hi> thinking to be diſcouered) what great newes haue you learned? All (ſayd <hi>Daphnis)</hi> that I deſired to know. Will you then (ſayd <hi>Filander)</hi> ſatisfie your ſelfe with your curioſity? As well (anſwered ſhe) as you; and you are like to finde hurt of your deceit. For this keeping about <hi>Diane,</hi> and this great affection which you make ſhew of to her, will bring you (in the end) but trouble and diſpleaſure. O God! (cryed <hi>Filander)</hi> Is it poſſible I ſhould be diſcouered? Ah diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:177519:94"/>
                     <hi>Daphnis)</hi> ſince you know ſo well the cauſe of my abode heere, you haue in your hands my life and my death; but if you will bethinke you of what I am, and what offices of amity you haue receiued from me, when occaſion is preſented, I will rather beleeue, that you wiſh my good and contentment, more then my deſpayre and ruine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Daphnis</hi> as yet thought ſhe ſpake to <hi>Callyre,</hi> and had opinion, that this feare was becauſe of <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> who would take it euill, if hee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that ſhe did this office to her brother; and to aſſure him, ſayd: You ought to be ſo farre from doubting that I know of your affayres, that if you had informed me, I ſhould haue yeelded all the counſell, and all the aſſiſtance which you could deſire of mee. But tell mee this deſſigne from poynt to poynt, that your freeneſſe may binde me more to your ſeruice, than the miſtruſt you haue had of me, gaue me offence. I will, <hi>O Daphnis</hi> (ſayd he) prouided, that you promiſe me, not to tell it to <hi>Diane,</hi> vntill I giue conſent. This is a diſcourſe (anſwered the ſhepheardeſſe,) which we ſhall make to no good purpoſe to her, her humor heerein being more ſtrange then you are aware of. That is my griefe (ſayd <hi>Philander)</hi> hauing from the beginning knowne, that I enterpriſe a deſſigne almoſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For, when my ſiſter and I reſolued to change habit, ſhee taking mine, and I hers, I well fore-ſawe, that all that would be to mine aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was, that I might conuerſe more freely with her, for ſome few dayes, (ſo diſguiſed) that ſhe might not know me for <hi>Filander.</hi> How! (interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Daphnis</hi> all ſurprized) how, for <hi>Filander?</hi> and are not you <hi>Callyre?</hi> The ſhepheard, that thought ſhe had knowne it before, was halfe mad to be diſcouered ſo fooliſhly; but ſeeing the fault was paſt, and that he could not call backe the words he had ſpoken, thought it to ſome pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to preuent her, and ſayd: You may ſee <hi>(Daphnis)</hi> if you haue cauſe to be ſorry for me; and to ſay that I truſt you not, ſince ſo freely I diſcouer vnto you the ſecret of my life. For, that which I will tell you, is of that moment, that as ſoone as any other knowes it, there is no more hope of health in me: but I will rely, and ſo referre my ſelfe to your hands, that I cannot liue but by you. Know then (ſhepheardeſſe) that you ſee before you <hi>Filander</hi> in the habit of his ſiſter; and that loue in me, and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in her, haue beene the cauſe of our diſguiſing: and after went diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vnto her his extreme affection, the fauours he had of <hi>Amidor</hi> and <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidas,</hi> the inuention of <hi>Callyre</hi> to change habit, &amp; the reſolution to go to her husband, attired like a man: Briefly, all that had paſſed in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayre, with ſuch demonſtration of loue, that though, at the beginning, <hi>Daphnis</hi> wondred at his hardineſſe, and at his ſiſters; yet ſo it was, that ſhe
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:177519:94"/>
loſt that wonder, when ſhe knew the greatneſſe of his affection, iudging that they might draw him into more great follies. And albeit that if they had called her to thier counſell, when they vndertooke the enterprize, ſhe would neuer haue aduiſed them to it: yet ſeeing the effect had ſorted to ſome good, ſhe reſolued to aſſiſt him in all that was poſsible, ſparing neyther labour, nor care, nor art, which ſhe iudged fit to imploy; and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing made promiſe, with all aſſurances of friendſhip, ſhe gaue the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice ſhe could, which was (by little and little) to engage me into his loue. For (ſayd ſhe) Loue among women, is one of thoſe wrongs, the words whereof offend more then the blowe. It is a worke that none is aſhamed to doe, prouided the name be hidden: So that I hold them the beſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, which cauſe themſelues to be beloued of their ſhepheards, before they ſpeake a word to them of loue. So that I oue is a creature that hath nothing rude in it, but the name, being otherwiſe ſo pleaſing, that there is none offended at it. And therefore, that <hi>Diane</hi> may entertayne it, it muſt be without naming it, eſpecially without ſeeing it, and ſuch wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome muſt be vſed, that ſhe muſt loue you, as ſoone as ſhe may know that you loue her out of loue. For being once embarked, ſhe cannot retire her ſelfe into the hauen, though ſhe ſee likelyhood of torment round about her.</p>
                  <p>It ſeemes hither to you haue beene guyded by great wiſedome: but you muſt proceed. The ſhew which you haue vſed, to be in loue with her, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you be a woman, is to good purpoſe; it being certayne, that all loue which is ſuffered, in the end, will prooue anſwerable. But you muſt goe forward. We doe eaſily many things, which we thought very hard, if Cuſtome had not made them eaſie. Therefore it is, that they which are not acquainted with a meate, find it at the firſt, to be of an harſh raſte, which by little and little (afterward) becomes pleaſing to the vſage. You muſt frame your ſelfe to vſe amorous diſcourſes to <hi>Diane,</hi> to make it more eaſie, that by cuſtome, that which ſhe hath not bin vſed vnto, may be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary: and the better to attayne it, you muſt deuiſe ſome inuention to make her more to delight in your wooing; and that you may do, though you be a woman, in the ſame termes that the ſhepheards vſe. For as the eare which is accuſtomed to muſike, is capable to fit his voyce both by rayſing and abaſing it to tunes that be harmonious, though otherwiſe they know nothing in that arte: In like manner, the ſhepheardeſſe, which often hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>es the diſcourſe of her louer, yeelds the powers of her ſoule, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit ſhe know not how to loue, letting her ſelfe to be carried in an inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible manner to the feelings of loue. I meane, ſhee loueth the company of
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:177519:95"/>
that perſon, in feeling a farre off ſome pitty of his euill; and in concluſion, loues (in effect) without thinking ſo much. Looke to it <hi>(Filander)</hi> you make profit of theſe inſtructions elſe-where, and think, that if I loued you not, and did not pitty you, I would not diſcouer this ſecret out of the ſchoole: but take that which I ſay, as an earneſt of that I deſire to doe for you.</p>
                  <p>With ſuch words, ſeeing the day approched, they returned into their lodging, not without ieſting at the loue of <hi>Amidor,</hi> who tooke him for a mayd, reporting ſome part of his ſpeech to laugh at it. And about morning falling aſleepe in this reſolution, they lay longer in bed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence the loſſe of the night; which gaue commodity to the young <hi>Amidor</hi> to ſurprize them. And had it not beene, that at that time I came into their chamber, I beleeue, he had found out their deceit; for, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelfe to the bed of the fayned <hi>Callire,</hi> though ſhe played her part well, ſpeaking with as great modeſty as was poſsible, ſetting on it a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uere countenance, to put him by the hardineſſe to hazzard himſelfe; yet it may be, his affection would haue found licence, and his vnwiſe hands might haue diſcouered her boſome. But immediately vpon my comming in, <hi>Daphnis</hi> deſired me to ſtay him, which I did, to the great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Filander,</hi> who ſayning to thanke me for it, kiſſed my hand with ſo great affection, that if I had beene any thing ſuſpitious, I ſhould haue perceiued, that indeed it had come of loue. After I had giuen them the good day, I tooke <hi>Amidor</hi> away with mee, that they might haue leiſure to clothe themſelues.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe they had a purpoſe to performe that which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, preſently after dinner, when wee were withdrawne (as of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome) vnder ſome trees, to enioy the freſh ayre, though <hi>Amidor</hi> were there, <hi>Daphnis</hi> thought the occaſion fit, being well pleaſed that it was in his preſence, to put him from all ſuſpition: and that if at any time, by miſchance, hee heard them ſpeake like a man, hee ſhould not thinke it ſtrange; when, making a ſigne to <hi>Filander,</hi> that hee would further this deſsigne, ſhe ſayd to him: And what is it, <hi>Callyre,</hi> can make you dumbe in the preſence of <hi>Diane?</hi> Becauſe (anſwered he) I go making many wiſhes to my ſelfe for the deſire I haue to the ſeruice of my miſtris; and among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, one which I neuer thought to deſire. What is that, interrupted <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midor?</hi> That is, continued <hi>Filander,</hi> that I wiſh to be a man, to doe more ſeruice to <hi>Diane.</hi> How, added <hi>Daphnis,</hi> are you amorous of her? More, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Filander,</hi> then all the reſt of the world is aware of.

You may thinke of me, as it pleaſeth you, ſaid I: I truely ſweare vnto you, that there is no man in the world, that I loue more then you. So (replyed hee to me) there is no perſon that hath vowed ſo much ſeruice to you: but this happineſſe, will laſt with me, but vntill you finde my ſmall merit, or ſome other better ſubiect preſent it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>Doe you thinke me, replyed I, ſo flitting as you make mee to bee? It is not, anſwered hee, for that I ſuppoſe in you the imperfections of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, but I know well, I am the cauſe of the defaults that be in me. The defaults, ſaid I, be rather on my ſide: and at that word I embraced him, &amp; kiſſed him, with as ſincere an affection, as if he had bene my ſiſter. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Daphnis</hi> ſmiled in her ſelfe, ſeeing me ſo much abuſed. But <hi>Amidor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting vs, iealous (as I beleeue) of them both: I thinke (ſaith he) it is in good earneſt, and that <hi>Callire</hi> mocks not. How (ſaid he) I mook? Let the heauens puniſh mee more rigorouſly, then they euer chaſtiſed periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red wretch, if there were euer any loue more violent, nor more paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, then that which I beare to <hi>Diane.</hi> And you were a man, added <hi>Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> you would learne well to vſe mens wordes, to declare your paſſion. Though, ſaid ſhe, I haue leſſe ſpirit; yet ſo it is, that my extreme affection will neuer ſuffer me to be dumbe in ſuch an occaſion. Let vs ſee (fayre) ſaid <hi>Amidor,</hi> if it be no trouble to you, how you will behaue your ſelfe in ſuch an enterprize. If my miſtriſſe, ſaid <hi>Filander,</hi> permit mee, I will doe it, with promiſe notwithſtanding, that ſhe condiſcend to three ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which I ſhall make to her. The firſt, that ſhee anſwere that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: the other, that ſhe thinke it not diſſembled, which vnder another perſon then <hi>Callire,</hi> I ſhall repreſent vnto her, but take them for true, though feeble paſſions. And laſtly, that ſhee neuer ſuffer any other then mee to ſerue her in this quality. I, that ſaw they all tooke pleaſure, and likewiſe in truth loued <hi>Filander</hi> vnder his ſiſters habit, anſwered, that for the ſecond and laſt demand, they were granted as ſhee deſired: that for the firſt, I was ſo vnaccuſtomed to make ſuch anſwers, that I aſſured my ſelfe ſhee would take ſmall pleaſure in them: yet, that I might deny him nothing, I aſſayed to acquit my ſelfe the beſt I could. At this word, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelfe on one of his knees, becauſe we were ſet round, taking one of my hands, he beganne in this ſort: I ſhould neuer haue thought<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> faire

miſtriſſe, conſidering ſo great perfections in you, that it ſhould be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a mortall to loue you, if I had not proued in my ſelfe, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſee you, and not to loue you: but knowing well, that heauen is too iuſt, to command you a thing impoſſible, I haue held for certaine, that it pleaſed you ſhould bee beloued, ſince it ſuffered you to bee ſeene. On this beleefe I haue fortified with reaſon, the hardineſſe I had to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold you, and in my heart bleſſe that weakeneſſe, which as ſoone ſubiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to you, as my eye was turned on you. Now if the lawes ordaine, that to euery one is to be giuen that which is his, thinke it not euill, faire ſhepheardeſſe, that I giue you my heart, ſince it is ſo acquired by you, that if you refuſe it, I will diſauow it for mine. At this word he held his peace, to heare what I would anſwer, but in ſuch a faſhion, that had hee not beene in the habit he wore, hardly might one doubt he ſpake in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt. And not to contradict that I promiſed him, I made him this anſwer: Shepheardeſſe, were the prayſes which you giue me true, I might haply beleeue that which you tell mee of your affection: but knowing well, that they be but flatteries, I cannot beleeue, but that the reſt are diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. This too much wounds your iudgement (ſayd he to me) to doubt of the greatneſſe of your merit, but with ſuch excuſes you are accuſtomed to refuſe the things which you like not of. I may truely ſweare by <hi>Teuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi> and you know well, I will not beperiured, that you neuer refuſed any thing that was giuen you from a better, nor more intire good will. I know well (anſwered I) that the ſhepheards of this countrey are accuſtomed to vſe more words, where there is leſſe truth; and that they keepe among them as a thing approued, that the gods doe not harken to, nor puniſh the forſwearing of the amorous: if it be the peculiar fault of your ſhepheards, I referre my ſelfe to your knowledge: but I, that am a ſtranger, ſhould haue no part of their blemiſh, no more then I commit their fault, and yet from your owne more cruel words, muſt I draw ſome ſatisfaction for my ſelfe: for though the gods doe not puniſh the oathes of Louers (if I be not, as it ſeemeth you make doubt of) the gods will not forbeare to ſend mee the chaſtiſement of periury; and if they doe forbeare, you ſhalbe conſtrained to confeſſe, that not being puniſhed, I am then no diſſembler; and if I be a lyer and am not puniſhed, you muſt confeſſe that I am a Louer. And therefore, on which ſide ſoeuer your fayre ſpirit turneth it ſelfe, it knowes not how to deny, that there is no beauty on earth where <hi>Diane</hi> is fayre; and that neuer beauty was beloued, as yours is, of that ſhepheard that lies at your knees, and in this caſe implores the ſuccours of all the Graces, to draw one from you, which hee thinkes he merits, if a perfect Louer euer
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:177519:96"/>
found merit. If I be faire, replyed I, I referre it to the eyes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold me with ſound iudgement: but you cannot deny that you are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured, and a diſſembler; and I muſt tell you, <hi>Callire,</hi> that the confidence with which you ſpake to mee like a man, makes mee reſolue neuer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue words, ſince being a woman, you know ſo well to diſguiſe. And why, <hi>Diane</hi> (ſaid he then ſmiling) interrupt you ſo often your ſeruants diſcourſe? Do you wonder, that being <hi>Callire,</hi> I ſpeake to you with ſuch affection? Thinke that there is no weakeneſſe of condition, that ſhall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer make me diminiſh, but it muſt rather be an occaſion of preſeruing it, both more violent, &amp; more eternall, ſince there is nothing which ſo much diminiſheth the heat of deſire, as the inioying of that which is deſired: and this not being to be had betweene vs, you ſhal alwaies, euen to my coffin, be beloued, and I alwaies a Louer. And yet if <hi>Tireſias,</hi> after he had beene a woman, became a man, why may not I hope, that the gods may do me as great a fauour, if it pleaſed you? Beleeue me, faire <hi>Diane,</hi> ſince the gods doe nothing in vaine, there is no likelihood, that hauing placed in mee ſo perfect affection, they will ſuffer me to labour in vaine: and if nature haue made me a woman, my extreme loue will make me ſuch, as ſhall not bee vnprofitable. <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who ſaw that this diſcourſe went ſharpely on, and that it might be dangerous, that this Louer ſhould ſuffer himſelfe to be carried ſo farre, as to ſpeake the thing that might diſcouer him to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midor,</hi> interrupted him, ſaying, Without doubt, <hi>Callire,</hi> your loue ſhall not vnprofitably be beſtowed, ſo long as you ſerue this fayre ſhepheardeſſe, no more then the candle which ſpends not it ſelfe in vaine, ſo long as it giues light to them that are in the houſe: for all the reſt of the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but to ſerue this fayre, you ſhall haue well beſtowed your time, when you haue ſpent them in her ſeruice. But let vs change our diſcourſe, ſaid <hi>Amidor:</hi> for ſee, here comes <hi>Filidas,</hi> who will take no pleaſure to heare it, though you be a woman. And preſently <hi>Filidas</hi> came, who made vs all riſe to ſalute him. But <hi>Amidor,</hi> that paſſionately loued the fained <hi>Callire,</hi> when his couſin arriued, made that vſe of the time, that ſtealing away with <hi>Filander</hi> from the company, and taking her vnder the arme, began to ſpeake thus: Is it poſſible, faire ſhepheardeſſe, that the words you vſe to <hi>Diane,</hi> be true? or haue you onely ſpoken them, to ſhew the beauty of your ſpirit? Beleeue me, <hi>Amidor</hi> (anſwered he) I am no diſſembler, and I neuer ſaid any thing more truely, then the aſſurance which I haue giuen her of my affection; and if in any thing I haue failed in the truth, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſpake leſſe then I feele: but heerein am I to bee excuſed, ſince there bee not wordes good enough to conceaue. Whereto hee anſwered with a great ſigh, Since it is ſo, faire <hi>Callyre,</hi> I can hardly beleeue, but you
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:177519:97"/>
will much better conceiue the affection is borne you, ſince you feele the ſame blowes wherewith you wound others, more then them that are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ignorant; and that ſhall be the cauſe, that I will not goe to ſeek out other words, to ſhew you what I ſuffer for you, nor other reaſons to excuſe my boldneſſe, then thoſe you haue vſed in your ſpeech to <hi>Diane;</hi> onely I will adde this conſideration, to the end you may know the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of my affection; that if the blow, which cannot bee auoyded, muſt be iudged according to the arme that gaue it, the beauty of <hi>Diane,</hi> whoſe wound you feele, being much leſſe then yours, muſt haue wrought leſſe hurt in you then yours in me. And yet if you loue with ſo great violence, conſider how <hi>Amidor</hi> ought to be vſed of <hi>Callire,</hi> and what his affection may be; for he knowes not how to declare it better, then by the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon with yours. Shepheard (anſwered hee) if the knowledge which you haue of the loue I beare to <hi>Diane,</hi> haue giuen you the boldneſſe to ſpeake to mee in this faſhion, I muſt beare the puniſhment, which my want of conſideration deſerues, in ſpeaking ſo openly before you: but ſo likewiſe are you to regard, that being a woman, I cannot by that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe preiudice her honeſty; but you doe mine, in talking ſo to mee, who haue an husband, that will not beare with patience this wrong, if hee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood it. But beſides, ſince you ſpeake of <hi>Diane,</hi> to whom (in truth) I am intirely giuen, I muſt tell you, that if you will that I ſhould meaſure your affection by mine, according to the cauſes which wee haue to loue, I do not thinke you loue much, ſince that which you name beauty in me, may not in any ſort retaine that name, being by hers. Faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſaid <hi>Amidor)</hi> I neuer thought one could offend you in louing you: but ſince it is ſo, I confeſſe that I deſerue chaſtiſement, &amp; am ready to receiue what you ſhall award. It is true, you ought alſo to adde to the ſame pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment al that I ſhal deſerue in louing you the reſt of my life, for it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible I ſhuld liue without louing you. And do not think, the diſpleaſure of <hi>Gereſtan</hi> ſhal euer diuert me: he that feares neyther hazzard nor death, will neuer dread a man. But for that which touches you, I confeſſe I haue failed in comparing you with <hi>Diane,</hi> being (without doubt) ill proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned on her ſide. It is true, that it is not as of a thing equall, but as of the leſſe with the greater: and being of opinion, that that which you feele, may giue you more knowledge of my payne, I haue committed this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, wherein, if you pardon me, I proteſt neuer to fall into it againe. <hi>Filan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which loued me in good earneſt, and was of opinion, that <hi>Amidor</hi> did ſo likewiſe, could hardly brooke to heare him ſpeake of mee with ſuch miſprize, if he had not had a purpoſe to diſcouer what it was, but deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:177519:97"/>
to cleare<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> himſelfe, and thinking he found a good occaſion, hee had ſo much power ouer himſelfe, that without making ſhew of it, hee ſayd, What, is it poſſible, <hi>Amidor,</hi> that your mouth ſhould vtter thoſe words, which your heart giues the lye ſo ſtrongly to? Thinke you that I know not well, that you are a diſſembler, and that long ſince, your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath beene for <hi>Diane?</hi> My affection (replyed he as ſurprized?) let ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any loue me, if I loue other ſhepheardeſſe then you.</p>
                  <p>I ſay not, but ſometimes I haue beene one of her friends: but her vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall humour, ſometimes all on fire, ſometimes cold like yce, hath ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mooued me, that at this time ſhe is indifferent vnto me. How (ſayd <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander)</hi> dare you ſay ſo, ſince I know, that indeed ſhe hath loued you, and doth yet loue you? I deny not (ſayd <hi>Amidor)</hi> but ſhe hath loued me: and going on ſomewhat ſmiling, I will not ſweare ſhe loues me not yet: but I can ſuffer it well, ſo ſhe be not beloued of me; and I leaue all the care to her. This which <hi>Amidor</hi> ſpake, was much after his humour; for it was his vſuall vanity, to deſire that men might thinke he had great good fortunes: and for this cauſe it was his manner, to make himſelfe (of purpoſe) ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with them he conuerſed with, that when he would draw backe, he could (with his ſmile and cold laughter) make men beleeue what he liſted of them. At this bout <hi>Filander</hi> found out his craft, and had it not beene that he feared to diſcouer himſelfe, he found himſelfe ſo touched with my wrong, that I thinke he had reprooued him for his lie, yet could hee not forbeare to anſwer him ſowrely enough. Truly, <hi>Amidor,</hi> you are the moſt vnworthy ſhepheard that liues in ſo good company, you haue the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to talke in this ſort of <hi>Diane,</hi> to whom you haue profeſſed ſo much goodwill, and to whom you are ſo much obliged: What may we hope, we that come ſhort of her in merit, ſince neyther her perfections, nor her friendſhip, nor your alliance can curbe your tongue? For my part, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you to be the moſt dangerous perſon liuing: and who deſires quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, muſt be carefull to ſhunne you as a diſeaſe moſt contagious. At this word he left him, and came to ſeeke vs. His viſage ſo inflamed with choler, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> knew wel he was diſpleaſed with <hi>Amidor,</hi> who ſtood ſo amazed at this parting, that he knew not what to doe. Afterward, in the euening <hi>Daphnis</hi> enquired of <hi>Filander,</hi> of their diſcourſe; and becauſe ſhee loued mee, and iudged that ſhee could not chooſe but encreaſe the loue which I bare the fayned <hi>Callire;</hi> in the morning ſhe told it me, with that ſharpenes againſt <hi>Amidor,</hi> &amp; ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modiouſly for <hi>Fila<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der,</hi> that I muſt confeſſe, that ſince I could not eaſily hold my ſelfe from louing him, when I acknowledged (to my thinking) that his good wil had bound me to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:177519:98"/>
But <hi>Daphnis,</hi> who knew well, that if I loued him then, it was becauſe I thought him to be <hi>Callire,</hi> and daily counſelled him to diſcouer himſelfe to me, ſaying, that at the firſt I would reiect him, and be angry, but in the end, things ſhould be ſo orderd, and for her part, ſhe would labor in that ſort, that ſhee hoped it might be brought about. But ſhee had not ſo ſtrong perſwaſions, that they could giue him courage, which made <hi>Daphne</hi> reſolue to do it her ſelfe, without his knowledge, fore-ſeeing well that <hi>Gereſtan</hi> would haue his wife home, and then all this craft would be to no purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>In this reſolution, one day, when ſhe found me alone, after ſome or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſcourſe, But what ſhall become in the end (ſayd ſhe) of this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Callyre?</hi> I beleeue verily you will make her loſe her right minde: for ſhe loues you ſo paſsionately, that I thinke ſhe cannot liue. If <hi>Filidas</hi> goe one day forth to lye abroad, and you will one night come out of your chamber, you ſhall ſee her in that caſe that I haue often found her in: for almoſt euery night that is fayre, ſhe ſpends them in the garden; and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth her ſelfe ſo with her owne imaginations, that I can ſcarce draw her (but with force) to her reſt. I would gladly (ſayd I) giue her ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort: but what would ſhe haue of me? Do not I render her loue for loue? Do I not expreſſe it ſufficiently in all mine actions? Want I any kinde of courteſie or duty towards her? It is true: but (replyed ſhe) if you heard her diſcourſes, I thinke not but you would haue compaſsion, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, that, without her knowledge, you would come to heare her one night. I promiſed her very freely, and told her, it ſhould be ſhortly: for <hi>Filidas</hi> told me the night before, ſhe would goe ſee <hi>Gerestan,</hi> and fall in league with him.</p>
                  <p>Some dayes after, <hi>Filidas,</hi> according to his purpoſe, carrying <hi>Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor</hi> with him, departed to ſee <hi>Gerestan,</hi> reſoluing not to returne of ſeuen or eight dayes, that he might giue greater token of his loue; and this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue fell out fitly for vs; for if he had beene at home, hardly ſhould we haue concealed the trouble wherein we were. Now the day of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting, <hi>Filander</hi> following his cuſtome, fayled not to go downe into the garden, halfe vndreſt, when he thought euery body aſleepe. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, <hi>Daphnis</hi> that went firſt to bed, as ſoone as ſhee ſawe her goe out, made haſte to tell me; and haſtily caſting a cloake about me, I followed her ſpeedily enough, vntill we were in the garden. But when ſhe percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued where he was, ſhe made ſigne to me to come ſoftly after. And when wee were come neere, ſo that wee might heare, we ſate downe vpon the ground, and preſently after I heard him ſay, But wherefore is all this pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience?
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:177519:98"/>
to what end are all theſe delayes? Muſt thou not die without ſuccour? or where mayſt thou lay thy wound open to the Surgeon that can heale it? And then reſting a little while, hee beganne agayne with a great ſigh, Say not thou, O troubleſome feare, that ſhe will baniſh vs from her preſence, and that ſhee will ordayne vs to a deſperate death. Well, if we die, ſhall it not be a great ſolace to vs to abridge ſo miſerable a life as ours is, and by death ſatisfie the offence we haue done? And as for baniſhment, if it come not from her, how may we auoyde it by <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restan,</hi> whoſe impaciencie will not ſuffer vs to ſtay longer heere? If yet we obtayne a longer ſtay of this importunate man, and that death do not befall vs from the anger of the fayre <hi>Diane,</hi> alas! can we auoyd the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of our affections? What muſt I then doe? that I tell her of it? Ah! I ſhall offend her for euer, if it were poſſible for me. Shall I conceale it? and why conceale it, when my death ſhall giue her a ſpeedy knowledge? Why ſhould I then offend her? Ah! Wrong and Loue will neuer go to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Let vs rather die. But if I conſent to my death, doe I not make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er loſe the moſt faithfull ſeruant that euer ſhe had? I will tell it her then, and at that time I will open my boſome, that the yron may more eaſily puniſh my errour, if ſhe will. Behold (will I ſay) where the heart of the vnfortunate <hi>Filander</hi> is, who vnder the habit of <hi>Callire,</hi> in ſtead of gayning your fauour; hath met with your diſpleaſure; reuenge your ſelf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it, and be aſſured; that if the reuenge ſatisfie you, the puniſhment ſhall be welcome to him.</p>
                  <p>Faire ſhepheardeſſes, when I heard <hi>Filander</hi> ſpeake in this ſort, I knew not what became of mee, I was taken with ſuch an aſtoniſhment. I know wel I would haue gone away, that I might ſee no more of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, ſo full of deſpight that I trembled agayne. But <hi>Daphnis,</hi> for the full accompliſhment of her treaſon, held me by force: and becauſe (as I told you) we were very neere the ſhepheard, at the firſt noyſe wee made, hee turned his head, and thinking it was but <hi>Daphnis;</hi> he came to her: but when hee perceiued mee, and that he thought I had heard him, O God (ſaid he) what puniſhment ſhall wipe out my fault? Ah <hi>Daphnis!</hi> I neuer looked for this treaſon from you. And, at this word hee ranne vp and downe the garden like a madde man, although ſhee called him twice or thrice by the name of <hi>Callyre;</hi> but fearing to be heard of others, and the rather, that deſpayre might not make <hi>Filander</hi> doe ſome euill to his owne perſon, ſhe left me alone, and ranne to follow him, ſaying to mee in choler at her going: You ſhall ſee <hi>(Diane)</hi> that if you deale hardly with <hi>Filander,</hi> it may be you will ruine your ſelfe ſo, that you may feele the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:177519:99"/>
greateſt diſpleaſure. If I were amazed at this accident (fayre ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes) you may well iudge when I knew not which way to returne. At laſt, after I had ſome deale recouered my ſpirits, I ſearched ſo on euerie ſide, that I got into my chamber, where hauing layd mee in my bed all trembling, I could not cloſe mine eyes all that night.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Daphnis,</hi> ſhee made ſuch ſearch for <hi>Filander,</hi> that at laſt ſhee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> found him rather dead then aliue: and after ſhe had chidden him, for not knowing how to make vſe of ſo fauourable an occaſion, and yet aſſured him that I was not ſo amazed at this accident as he, ſhee brought him a little to himſelfe, and in ſome ſort aſſured him, but not ſo, that the next morning he had the boldneſſe to goe out of his chamber. I on the other ſide, infinitely offended with them both, was conſtrayned to keepe my bed, that I might not giue notice of my diſpleaſure to them that were about vs; and particularly, to the neece of <hi>Gerestan:</hi> but by good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſhe was not more ſpritefull then reaſon would; ſo that we eaſily hid from her this euill carriage, which was (almoſt) impoſſible for vs, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for <hi>Filander,</hi> about whom ſhe ordinarily kept. <hi>Daphnis</hi> found her ſelfe not a little impeached by this occaſion; for at the firſt I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her excuſes. At laſt, ſhe ſo turned me on all ſides, and knew ſo well to diſguiſe this affection, that I promiſed her to forget the diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure which ſhe had done me, ſwearing notwithſtanding, as for <hi>Filander,</hi> that I would neuer ſee him more. And I beleeue he had gone away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing me, as not able to endure my anger, had it not beene for the danger whereinto he feared <hi>Callyre</hi> might fall; for ſhe had to doe with an husband that was froward enough.</p>
                  <p>This was the conſideration that held him backe: but not riſing from his bed, fayning to be ſicke, fiue or ſixe dayes paſſed before I would ſee him, what reaſon ſoeuer <hi>Daphnis</hi> could alledge in his behalfe: and had it not beene that I was aduertiſed, that <hi>Filidas</hi> would returne, and <hi>Callire</hi> alſo, I had not ſeene him of a long time. But the feare I had <hi>Filidas</hi> might not marke it, and that which was ſo ſecret might not be<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> publiſhed tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the countrey, made me to reſolue to ſee him, on condition that he ſhould make no ſhew of that which was paſſed, hauing not ſufficient power ouer my ſelfe, to ſtay me from giuing ſome knowledge of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. He promiſed it, and performed it: for hee durſt hardly turne his eyes towards me; and when hee did, it was a certayne ſubmiſſion, which gaue me no ſmall aſſurance of his extreme loue. And by fortune, preſently after I was entred, <hi>Filidas, Amidor,</hi> and the diſſembled <hi>Filander</hi> came into the chamber, the windowes whereof being ſhut, gaue vs good
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:177519:99"/>
commodity to hide our faces. <hi>Filander</hi> aduertiſed his ſiſter of all that had happened: and that was the cauſe that the ſtay of <hi>Filidas</hi> was not ſo long as he purpoſed; for ſeeing that her ſiſter was ſicke, ſhe conſtrayned them to returne.</p>
                  <p>But this diſcourſe would be too tedious, if I ſhould not abridge all our ſmall quarrels. So it was, that <hi>Callire</hi> knowing how things had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſometimes turning them into ſport, ſometimes ſeeking out ſome likelihoods of reaſon, knew ſo well to ſerue her turne by fayre ſpeech, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially being aſſiſted by <hi>Daphnis,</hi> that at laſt I conſented, that <hi>Filander</hi> ſhould ſtay vntill his ſiſters hayres were growne, knowing well that it might ruine her, and my ſelfe alſo, if I ſhould be ouer-haſty of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne. And it fell out as ſhe well foreſawe, that during the time that her head grew, the ordinary conuerſing with the ſhepheard, which at the laſt was not vnpleaſing to me, and the tryall of the greatneſſe of his loue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to flatter mee (in ſuch ſort) that of my ſelfe I excuſed his deceit; conſidering withall, the reſpect and wiſedome wherewith it was carried: So that before he was to goe away, he obtayned this fauour which he ſo much deſired, to wit, that I would forget his crafty deceit; and ſo long as hee went not beyond the termes of his duty, I loued his good will, and would cheriſh it for his merit as I ought. The acknowledgement which he gaue me of his contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, hauing this aſſurance from me, made me al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ as aſſured of his affection, as I was before certayne of his diſpleaſure: for he was ſuch an one, that he could hardly diſſemble. While we were in theſe termes, <hi>Filidas,</hi> whoſe loue went on ſtill increaſing, could no longer hide the greatneſſe of it, ſo that ſhe reſolued to ſet at once on the diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Filander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>With this purpoſe, finding her at leiſure, one day as they walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether vnder a tuft of trees, which tooke vp one of the quarters of the garden, he ſpake vnto her in this ſort, after he had beene long denyed: Well, <hi>Filander,</hi> ſhall it be true, that what loue ſoeuer I can make ſhew of, I cannot haue the happineſſe to be beloued of you? <hi>Callire</hi> anſwered him, I know not what more loue you can demaund of me, nor how I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne you more, vnleſſe your ſelfe giue me the meane. Ah (ſayd ſhe) if your will be ſuch as mine, I may well doe it. For that triall which you haue had of me till now, why will you doubt me? Know you not (ſayd <hi>Filidas)</hi> that extreme deſire is alwayes attended by doubt? Sweare vnto me, you wil not be wanting in poynt of Loue, and I will ſhew you a thing (it may be) you will be aſtoniſhed at. <hi>Callire</hi> was ſomewhat ſurprized, not knowing what ſhe would ſay; yet, to know the concluſion, ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered:

I ſweare to you I doe. At this word, for thanks, and almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides himſelfe for ioy; <hi>Filidas</hi> taking her by the head, kiſſed her with that vehemency, that <hi>Callire</hi> waxed red, and in choler, thruſting her off, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, what faſhion this was? I know (anſwered <hi>Filidas)</hi> this kiſſe amazed you, and my actions, till now (it may be) haue made you ſuſpect ſome ſtrange thing in me: but if you will haue the patience to hearken to mee, I aſſure my ſelf, you wil rather pity than haue an euil opinion: and repeating from the beginning, till that bout, ſhe gaue him to vnderſtand the lawe ſuite betweene <hi>Phormion</hi> and <hi>Celion,</hi> the accord which was made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe them, and laſtly, the policy his father vſed to bring him vp as a man (though ſhe were a woman,) ſhortly, our marriage, and all that which I haue told you, and then held on in this ſort: Now that which I deſire of you in ſatisfaction of your promiſe, is, that finding the extreme affection which I beare you, you will take me for your wife, and I will marry <hi>Diane</hi> to my couſin <hi>Amidor,</hi> whom my father hath purpoſely brought vp in his houſe for that cauſe. And then moreouer, added ſuch words to perſwade her, that <hi>Callire</hi> aſtoniſhed more then I can tell you, and hauing ſome lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to come to her ſelfe, anſwered, that vnfainedly ſhe had told him ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtrange things, and ſuch as ſhe could hardly beleeue, if ſhe did not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure them in another faſhion then by words. She then vnbuttoning her ſelfe, opened her boſome; Honeſty (ſayd ſhee) forbiddeth mee to ſhew more: but me thinkes this might ſatisfie you.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Callire,</hi> that ſhe might winne the leiſure to take counſell of vs, made ſhew to be well pleaſed, but that ſhe had parents from whom ſhe hoped to haue all her aduanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and without whoſe aduice ſhe was not to make a reſolution of that importance; and aboue all, beſought her to keepe this affaire ſecret: for, divulging it, would giue men occaſion of ſpeech, and ſhe ſhould aſſure her ſelfe, that when there remayned nothing but her conſent, ſhe would giue proofe of her good will. With ſuch talke they ended their walke, and returned to their lodging, where all that day <hi>Callire</hi> durſt not come neere vs, for feare leſt <hi>Filidas</hi> might thinke ſhe had told it vs. But at night, ſhe recounted to her brother all the diſcourſe, and then they both went to finde out <hi>Daphnis,</hi> whom they made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with it. Iudge, if the aſtoniſhment were great: but whatſoeuer it were, the contentment of <hi>Philander</hi> ſurpaſſed it farre, he thinking the heauens had offered him a fayre way to the concluſion of his deſires. In the morning <hi>Daphnis</hi> deſired me to go ſee the fayned <hi>Callire,</hi> and the true one abode neere <hi>Filidas,</hi> to the end he might not doubt it. God knowes what became of me, when I knew all this diſcourſe. I ſweare vnto you, I
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:177519:100"/>
was ſo aſtoniſhed, that I knew not whether it were a dreame. But this was the ſport, that <hi>Daphnis</hi> complayned infinitely of mee, for hauing ſo long concealed it from her, and what oathes I made her, that I knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till that time. She would not beleeue me to be ſuch a childe; and when I told her, I thought all men like <hi>Filidas,</hi> ſhe fell a laughing at my ignorance. In the end we reſolued, for feare leſt <hi>Belinde</hi> would diſpoſe of me at her pleaſure, or that <hi>Filidas</hi> might make ſome attempt for <hi>Amidor,</hi> that we muſt doe nothing at randon, and without fore-thinking. For as then, by the ſollicitation of <hi>Daphnis</hi> and <hi>Callire,</hi> I promiſed <hi>Philander</hi> to marry him. This was the cauſe, that taking agayne their owne habits, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had aſſured <hi>Filidas</hi> that he went to talke with his parents, he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with his ſiſter to <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> who neuer tooke notice of this diſguiſing. From that time it was permitted to <hi>Philander</hi> to write to me: for ſending ordinarily newes to <hi>Filidas,</hi> I had alwayes his letters, and that ſo cunning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that neyther ſhe, nor <hi>Amidor</hi> euer perceiued them.</p>
                  <p>Now fayre ſhepheardeſſes, till this time, this paſſage neuer brought me ſorrow; but alas! it is that which followed, that caſt me into ſuch a bottomleſſe pit, that euen to my coffin I muſt neuer hope to taſte any ſweet thing. It fell out to my misfortune, that a ſtranger paſſing thorow that Countrey, ſpyed me ſleeping at the fountayne of <hi>Sicamores,</hi> where the cooleneſſe of the ſhadow, and ſweet murmuring of the water about the middeſt of the day had made me ſleepe. He whom the beauty of the place had brought thither, to ſpend the heat of the day, no ſooner caſt his eyes on me, but he noted ſome thing that pleaſed him. O gods! what man, or rather, what monſter was this? he had a viſage ſhining again for black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, his hayre curled, and like the wooll of our ſheepe, after they haue beene a moneth or two ſhorne, his beard in little tufts about his chinne, his noſe flat betweene his eyes, but high and large at the end, his mouth great, his browes frowning and hanging ouer his noſe; but nothing was ſo ſtrange as his eyes, for in all his face there appeared nothing white, but that which he ſhewed when he rowled them in his head. This fayre louer was deſtined me by the heauens, to put me quite out of loue with louing: For, being rauiſhed to behold me, he could not contayne (tranſported, as I thinke, with this new deſire) but approaches to kiſſe me. But becauſe he was in armor, and on horſe-backe, the noyſe that he made, awoke me, and in ſo good time, that as he was about to ſtoope to ſatisfie his will, I opened mine eyes, and ſeeing this monſter ſo neere me, at the firſt I cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and then laying my hand on his face, I ſtrucke him with all my might: he that was halfe leaning, not looking for this defence, was ſo

ſurprized, that the blow made him ſtagger, and for feare (as I thinke) he ſhould tumble on me, he choſe rather to fall on the other ſide, ſo that I had leiſure to riſe: I thinke if he had touched me, I ſhould haue dyed of very feare. For imagine, that whatſoeuer is moſt horrible, yet it comes ſhort of the terribleneſſe of his fearefull viſage. I was gone a pretty way off by that time he could riſe vp: and ſeeing that he could not ouer-take me, by reaſon he was heauily armed, and that Feare tyed wings to my feet, he mounted preſently on his horſe, and with a full gallop followed me, when (almoſt out of breath) the poore <hi>Filidas,</hi> which hard by enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned <hi>Philander,</hi> who was come to ſee vs, and was falne aſleepe, as they talked, hearing my voyce, ranne to me, ſeeing this cruell fellow pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue me with his naked ſword in his hand, for the choler of his fall wiped away all loue, ſhe generouſly oppoſed againſt his fury, manifeſting to me, by that laſt act, that ſhe had loued me as much as her ſexe would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and layd hold on the bridle of the horſe; whereat this barbarous fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low was ſo offended, that without regard of humanity, hee ſtrucke him with his ſword on his arme, with ſuch a force, that he cut it from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and ſhee then almoſt dead with ſmart, fell downe vnder the horſes feet, who beganne to bound ſo roughly, that his maſter had much to do to ſtay him. And becauſe <hi>Filidas</hi> (in dying) gaue a great cry, naming <hi>Philander</hi> aloude, he being neere, heard her, and ſeeing her in ſo pitti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a caſe, was extremely offended: but much more, when hee ſawe this barbarous companion, being alighted from his horſe, ranne after me with his ſword in his hand; and I, as I tell you, what with feare, and what with the courſe I had made, ſo much out of breath, that I could ſcarce ſet one legge before another: what became of this poore ſhepheard? I doe not thinke, that euer Lion robbed of her whelpes, when ſhee ſawe them carried away, ranne more mainely after them, then the couragious <hi>Philander</hi> after this cruell wretch. And becauſe hee was laden with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that hindered his running, he ouer-tooke him quickely, and cryed: Forbeare, knight, forbeare any more to wrong her that deſerueth rather to be adored: and becauſe he would not ſtay, were it for that being in a fury, hee heard not his voyce, or being a ſtranger, vnderſtood not his language, <hi>Philander</hi> putting a ſtone into his Sling, caſt it with ſuch a force, that hitting him on the head, but for the armour which he wore, without doubt, hee had killed him at that blowe, which was ſuch, that the ſtranger ſtooped agayne: but preſently rayſing him ſelfe, and forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the anger which he had againſt me, hee addreſſed himſelfe in a rage towards <hi>Philander,</hi> who was ſo neere, that hee could not auoyde the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:177519:102"/>
blowe he gaue him in his body, hauing nothing in his hand, but his ſheep-hooke for his defence. Notwithſtanding, ſeeing the ſword of his enemy ſo high, his naturall generoſity gaue him that ſtrength and courage, that inſtead of going backe, hee aduanced himſelfe forward, and ſetting his ſheep-hooke againſt his breſt, ranne the yron end of it betweene his eyes, ſo farre, that he could not draw it our, which was the cauſe, that thus leauing it faſtened, he tooke hold on his throat, and with his hands and teeth finiſhed the ſlaughter.</p>
                  <p>But alas, this was a victory dearely bought; for as this barbarous wretch fell downe dead on the one ſide, <hi>Philander</hi> (for want of ſtrength) was faine to let himſelfe fall on the other; but ſo lighting ouer-thwart, the ſword which lay croſſe the body, hit in the poynt againſt a ſtone, and the weight of his body made it come out of the wound. I that from time to time turned my head, to ſee if this cruell monſter had yet ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken me, ſawe well where <hi>Philander</hi> ranne, and then an extreme feare tooke me. But alas, when I ſawe him wounded ſo dangerouſly, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all feare, I ſtayed my ſelfe; but when he fell downe, the feare of death could not hold me from running to him, and almoſt as dead as he, I caſt my ſelfe on the ground, and called him all be-blubbered by his name. He had loſt much bloud, and ſtill loſt more from both ends of the wound. And ſee what force Loue hath: I that could not looke vpon bloud without ſwowning, had then the courage to thruſt my handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher into the wound, to ſtoppe the courſe of bloud; and tearing a piece of my veile, I put it into the other part. This little helpe ſtood him in ſome ſtead; for, hauing layd his head in my lappe, he opened his eyes, and came agayne to his ſpeech: And perceiuing me all couered with teares, he enforced himſelfe to ſay: If euer I hoped for an end more fauourable then this, I pray the heauens (fayre ſhepheardeſſe) that it take no pitty on me.</p>
                  <p>I ſawe well, that my ſmall merit could not bring me to the happineſſe deſired, and I feared, that at the laſt, deſpayre would conſtrayne me to ſome furious manner of reſolution againſt mine owne perſon.

And iudge what my contentment is, ſince I not onely die for you, but withall, in preſeruing to you the thing which of all the world you hold moſt deare, which is your chaſtity. Now miſtriſſe, ſince there remayneth nothing more to my contentment, but onely one poynt, by the affection which you haue found in <hi>Philander,</hi> I heartily pray you to

grant it mee, to the end that this happy ſoule may goe to expect you in the <hi>Eliſian</hi> fieldes, with this ſatisfaction from you. He ſpake this in broken words, and with much payne. And I that ſawe him in this caſe, to giue him all the contentment he could deſire, anſwered him: Friend, the gods haue not rayſed in you ſo good and honeſt affection to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it ſo preſently, and to leaue vs nothing but ſorrow: I hope they will giue you yet ſo much life, that I ſhall make you know, that I giue not place to you in loue, no more then you doe to any other in merit. And for proofe of that which I doe ſay, demaund you that onely thing which you would gladly haue of me, for there is nothing that I can or will deny you.</p>
                  <p>At theſe laſt words, he tooke me by the hand, and laying it to his mouth; I kiſſe (ſayth he) this hand by way of thankes, for the grace and fauour you haue done me; and then lifting vp his eyes to heauen: O God (ſayd he) I deſire of you but ſo much life, as may ſerue for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſe which <hi>Diane</hi> comes to make me: and then addreſſing his ſpeech to me, with ſuch paine, that he could hardly vtter a word, he ſayd thus vnto me, Now (fayre Miſtriſſe) heare then what it is I require of you: Since I feele not the anguiſh of death, but for you, I coniure you, by my affection, and by your promiſe, that I may carry this content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the world, that I may ſay, I am your husband; and beleeue me, if I doe obtayne it, my ſoule ſhall moſt contentedly goe into what place ſoeuer it muſt paſſe, hauing ſo great a teſtimony of your goodwill. I ſweare to you (fayre ſhepheardeſſes) that theſe words ſtrucke me ſo to the quicke, that I knew not how I was able to ſuſtayne my ſelfe: and, I thinke (for my part) it was onely the deſire I had to pleaſe him, that gaue me the courage. This was the cauſe that he had no ſooner ended his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund; but I griping his hand, ſayd, <hi>Philander,</hi> I graunt you that you demaund of me: and I ſweare to you, before all the gods, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly before the deities which are in this place, that <hi>Diane</hi> giues herſelfe to you, and that ſhe taketh you both in heart and ſoule for her husband: and in ſpeaking theſe words, I kiſſed him. And I (ſayd he) take you, my fayre miſtris, and giue my ſelfe to you for euer, right happy and content to beare the moſt glorious name of <hi>Diane.</hi> Alas, this word of <hi>Diane</hi> was the laſt word he vttered; for hauing his arme about my necke, and draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to him, to kiſſe me, he dyed, breathing his laſt vpon my lippes. How I looked, when I beheld him dead, you may eaſily iudge (fayre ſhepheardeſſes) ſince I ſo truly loued him. I fell groueling vpon him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pulſe, and without ſence, and fell into a ſwowning, ſo that I came
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:177519:103"/>
to my ſelfe without my owne knowledge. O God! how liueth my heart ſince I felt this loſſe, and found that to be too true, which ſo oftentimes he had foretold me, that I ſhould loue him more after his death, then du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring life; for I haue ſo liuely preſerued his remembrance in my ſoule, that (me thinketh) I haue him alwayes before mine eyes, and without ceaſing he ſayth to me, vnleſſe I will be vngratefull, I muſt loue him. So I doe (O good ſoule) and with the moſt entire affection that I can: and if where thou art, there be any knowledge of that which is done heere below, receiue (O deare friend) this good will, and theſe teares which I doe offer, in teſtimony that <hi>Diane</hi> loueth euen to her coffin, her deareſt <hi>Philander.</hi>

               <p>At this word they all three roſe, and went toward that part of their Hamlet, for it was well neere dinner time. But <hi>Leonide,</hi> who was, as I told you, harkening, loſt not one word of theſe ſhepheardeſſes; and the more ſhe heard of their newes, the more ſhe deſired to heare. But when ſhee ſaw them goe away without ſpeaking a word of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhee was much troubled; yet in hope ſhe might (ſtaying that day with them) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer

After dinner, they ſpent the time in deuices and demands which <hi>Leonide</hi> made; and among others, ſhe enquired what was become of a ſhepherd named <hi>Celadon,</hi> who was the ſonne of <hi>Alcippe. Diane</hi> anſwered, that ſome while agoe, he was drowned in <hi>Lignon.</hi> And his brother <hi>Licidas,</hi> is he married (ſaid ſhe?) Not yet (ſaid <hi>Diane)</hi> &amp; I think he hath no great haſte, for the diſpleaſure for his brother is yet too freſh in his memory. And by what misfortune (ſaid ſhe) did he miſcarry? He would haue ſuccoured (ſaid <hi>Diane)</hi> this ſhopheardeſſe, who was falne in before him; and then ſhe ſhewed her <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> The Nymph, who without making any ſuch ſhew, tooke heede to <hi>Aſtreas</hi> actions, ſeeing that on that remembrance, ſhe changed her countenance; and to hide this bluſhing, ſhe held her hand before her eyes, knew that ſhee loued him in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; and to diſcouer more, held on, And was the body neuer found? No (ſayd <hi>Diane)</hi> onely his hat was found, which was ſtayed at one of the trees, which the ſtreame of water had made bare at the roote. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who knew, that if this diſcourſe held further, it would draw teares from the eyes of her companion, who had much adoe to reſtraine them; that ſhe might interrupt it, But great Nymph, ſaid ſhe, what good fortune for vs
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:177519:105"/>
was that, that brought you to this place? At our firſt meeting (ſaid <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onide)</hi> I haue told you it. It was onely to haue the good of knowing you, and to enter league with you, deſirous to haue the pleaſure of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Since that is it (replyed <hi>Phillis)</hi> if you finde it good, it will be fit to goe, as vſually wee doe, to our accuſtomed exerciſes, and ſo you ſhall take more notice of our faſhio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of life; eſpecially, if you will giue vs leaue to vſe in your preſence, the liberties of our villages. That is it, ſaid <hi>Leonide,</hi> I would haue requeſted of you, for I know, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtraint is neuer pleaſing, &amp; I come not hither to diſpleaſe you. In this ſort, <hi>Leonide</hi> taking <hi>Diane</hi> by the one hand, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with the other, they went forth, and with many diſcourſings, came to a wood which runnes along to the banke of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and there hauing more moyſture, grew thicker, and made the place more like a forreſt. They were ſcarce ſet, when they heard one ſing neere them, and <hi>Diane</hi> was the firſt that knew the voyce: and turning toward <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de,</hi> Great Nymph (ſayd ſhe) doe you take pleaſure to heare the diſcourſe of a young ſhepheard, who hath nothing of the village, but the name and the habit? for hauing beene alwaies brought vp in the great Townes, and among ciuill perſons, he hath leſſe touch of our woods, then of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing. And who is he (anſwered <hi>Leonide?)</hi> It is (replyed <hi>Diane)</hi> the ſhepheard <hi>Siluander,</hi> who hath made abode among vs but 25. or 30. mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths. And of what Family (ſaid the Nymph) is he? It is an hard matter (added <hi>Diane)</hi> to tell you, for himſelfe knowes not who is his father and mother, only he hath ſome light coniecture, that they were of the <hi>Forreſts:</hi> and for this cauſe, when hee could, hee returned hither, with reſolution to goe no more away; and indeed, our <hi>Lignon</hi> would haue great loſſe if hee ſhould; for I doe not thinke there was a more accompliſhed ſhepheard of long time. You praiſe him too much (anſwered the Nymph) to make me deſirous to ſee him: let vs goe to entertaine him. If he perceiue vs here (ſaid <hi>Diane)</hi> and he thinke you deſire it, he will not faile to come ſoone e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to vs. And it fell out as ſhe ſayd, for the ſhepheard by fortune wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king abroad, ſeeing them, turned his pace towards them immediately, and ſaluted them. But becauſe he knew not <hi>Leonide,</hi> he made as though he would hold on his way; when <hi>Diane</hi> ſaid to him, Is it ſo, <hi>Siluander,</hi> that you haue learned this ciuility in the great Townes, to thruſt your ſelfe into ſo good company, and then to ſay nothing? The ſhepheard an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſmiling, Since I haue offended by interrupting you, I may the leſſe hold on in the fault, and ſo, as I thinke, may my error be leſſer. That is not it (anſwered <hi>Diane)</hi> that makes you part hence ſo ſoone, but rather, for that you finde nothing here worth your ſtay; yet if you turne your eyes on
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:177519:105"/>
this Nymph, I aſſure my ſelfe, that if you haue eies, you will not thinke you can finde better elſe-where. That which drawes any thing, replyed <hi>Siluander,</hi> muſt haue ſome ſympathy with it: but you may not thinke it ſtrange, that being no ſuch betweene ſo great worth and my imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that I haue not felt this attract which you reproach me for. Your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty (interrupted <hi>Leonide)</hi> hath made you put this vnlikeneſſe betweene vs; but thinke you it is in the body, or in the ſoule? For the body, your countenance, and the reſt which we ſee of you deny it; if it be in the ſoule, it ſeemes (if you haue it reaſonable) it differs nothing from ours. <hi>Sluan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> knew well he was not now to talke to ſhepheardeſſes, but with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of an higher ſtraine, which made him reſolue to anſwer with ſtronger reaſons, then he was vſed to haue among the ſhepheardeſſes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſayd thus: The price, faire Nymph, of all things in the world, is not valewed according to that we ſee of them, but according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per vſe of them: for otherwiſe, a man who is the moſt eſteemed, ſhould be the leaſt; ſince there is no creature which ſurpaſſeth not him in ſome things peculiar: one in ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth; another in ſwiftneſſe; another in ſight; an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other in hearing; &amp; ſuch like priuiledges of the body. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider that the gods haue made al theſe creatures to ſerue man, and man to ſerue God; we muſt confeſſe that the gods haue thought beſt of him. And by this reaſon I would tell you, that to know the price of any thing, we muſt haue an eye to the ſeruice the gods haue appointed it: for there is no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood, but that they know beſt the true value of euery thing. Now in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus with you and mee, who would not ſay but the gods are much miſtaken in vs, if being equall in merit, they ſerue themſelues of you, as a Nymph, and of me, as a ſhepheard? <hi>Leonide,</hi> in her mind commended the gentle ſpirit of this ſhepheard, which ſo well defended ſo bad a cauſe: and to giue him occaſion to ſpeake on, ſhe ſaid, Though this may bee allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in reſpect of mee, yet wherefore is it that theſe ſhepheardeſſes cannot ſtay you, ſince according to your ſpeech, they are to haue this conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with you? Wiſe Nymph, anſwered <hi>Siluander,</hi> the leſſer yeelds alwaies to the greater part; where you are, theſe ſhepheardeſſes muſt doe as you doe. And why (added <hi>Diane)</hi> diſdainefull ſhepheard, eſteeme you ſo ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly of vs? You ſhould rather thinke (anſwered <hi>Sluander)</hi> that it is for the good opinion I haue of you, that I thus ſpeake: for if I thought hardly of you, I would not ſay that you were a part of this great Nymph, ſince that thereby I make you no whit her inferiour, but that ſhe deſerues to be beloued and reſpected for her beauty, for her merits, and for her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and you, for your beauties and merits. You mock your ſelfe, <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uander</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:177519:106"/>
(anſwered <hi>Diane:)</hi> I would haue you thinke that I haue ſufficient to winne the affection of an honeſt ſhepheard. She ſpake thus, for that hee was ſo farre from all Loue, that among them, hee was alwaies called the vnſenſible, and ſhe delighted to make him talke. Whereto he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Your conceit may be as pleaſeth you, yet I muſt tell you, that for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting this, you want one of the principall parts. And what is that, ſaid <hi>Diane?</hi> The will (replyed he:) for your will is ſo contrary to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, that, ſaid <hi>Phillis</hi> interrupting him, <hi>Siluander</hi> would neuer loue more. The ſhepheard hearing her ſpeake, drew aſide to <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> ſaying, that they ouer-charged him, and that hee was wronged, when ſo many ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. The wrong (ſaid <hi>Diane)</hi> is turned onely to me: for this ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe ſeeing me in the hands of ſo ſtrong an enemy, and conceauing a ſiniſter iudgement of my courage and force, would haue helped me: It is not in this (ſaid he) faire ſhepheardeſſe, that ſhe hath offended you; for ſhe had had ſmall iudgement, if ſhe thought not your victory certaine: but it was, for that ſeeing me already vanquiſhed, ſhe would robbe you of the honor, in attempting to giue me a blow at the end of the combate; but I know not what her meaning was: for if you meddle no further, I aſſure you, ſhe ſhall not ſo eaſily get this glory as ſhe thinkes. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who of her nature was pleaſant, and who on this day reſolued to paſſe away the time for <hi>Leonide,</hi> anſwered him with a certaine lifting vp of her head: It is good <hi>(Siluander)</hi> that you haue an opinion, that to vanquiſh you, is a thing to be deſired, and honourable for me, I ſay, for mee, who will place this victory among the leaſt that euer I wanne. You ſhould not ſo much vnder-valew it, ſaid the ſhepheard, ſince this ſerues not but to be the firſt that hath conquered me. As much (replyed <hi>Phillis)</hi> as there is honour to bee the firſt in that which is of worth, ſo much ſhamefull is it in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Ah ſhepheardeſſe (interrupted <hi>Diane)</hi> ſpeake not ſo of <hi>Siluander:</hi> for if all the ſhepheards which are leſſe then he, ſhould bee vnder-valew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I know not him that we are to eſteeme. See <hi>Diane</hi> (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> the firſt blowes by which you come ouer him! without doubt, he is yours. It is the cuſtome of theſe haggard &amp; wilde ſpirits, to ſuffer themſelues to be taken at the firſt attracts; and for that they haue not beene acquainted with ſuch fauours, they receiue them with ſuch a taſte, that they haue not power to reſiſt them. <hi>Phillis</hi> ſpake theſe words to mock him: yet it fell out, that the gracious defence of <hi>Diane,</hi> made the ſhepheard thinke, that he was bound to ſerue her by the lawes of courteſie. And after that, that opinion, and the perfections of <hi>Diane,</hi> had that power ouer him, that hee conceaued this bud of Loue, that time and conuerſation might encreaſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:177519:106"/>
as we will tell you afterwards. This diſputation held ſome while among the ſhepheardeſſes, to the good contentment of <hi>Leonide,</hi> who wondred at their gentle ſpirit. <hi>Phillis,</hi> at laſt, turning her ſelfe to the ſhepheard, ſaid, But whereto ſerue ſo many wordes? If it bee true that you are ſuch, let vs come to the proofe of it, and ſhew me what ſhepheardeſſe makes any ſpeciall account of you. She (anſwered the ſhepheard) whom you ſee me make eſpeciall account of. You meane (added <hi>Phillis)</hi> that you ſeeke not after any: but that proceeds from want of courage. Much rather (replyed <hi>Siluander)</hi> from want of will. And then going onward, And you which vnder-valew me ſo much, tell vs what ſhepheard it is whom you loue ſo eſpecially? All them who haue ſpirit and courage (anſwered <hi>Phillis.)</hi> For whoſoeuer ſees that which is louely, without louing it, wanteth ſpirit or courage. That reaſon (ſayd <hi>Siluander)</hi> bindes you then to loue me, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe your ſelfe of great want. But let vs not ſpeake ſo generally: name one in particular, whom you loue. Then <hi>Phillis,</hi> with a countenance graue and ſeuere, I would with a good will there were boldnes enough to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it. That is then (added <hi>Siluander)</hi> for want of courage. Rather (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> want of will. Wherefore then (cryed out <hi>Siluander)</hi> would you it ſhould be thought more out of want of will in you, than in me? Would it be well (ſayd the ſhepheardeſſe) that the actions which do beſit you, ſhould be permitted me? Would you thinke well of it, if I ſhould runne, play on the Lute, or leape, as you do?</p>
               <p>But our diſputation is too long about ſo bad a ſubiect: let <hi>Diane</hi> ſet downe the concluſion, and ſee if I be not confident in the iuſtneſſe of my cauſe, ſince I take a partiall iudge. I ſhall be alwayes (anſwered <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane)</hi> according to the reaſon of my knowledge. Well (ſayd <hi>Phillis)</hi> when words cannot make good that which they would vphold, is he not bound to come to his proofes? Yes without doubt (anſwered <hi>Diane.)</hi> Condemne then this ſhepheard (ſayd <hi>Phillis)</hi> to giue proofe of the merit which hee ſayes is in him, and that on this occaſion to vndertake to ſerue and loue a ſhepheardeſſe of that ſort, that he will enforce her to confeſſe that hee deſerues to be beloued, that if he cannot, that hee freely acknowledge his little valour.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonide</hi> and the ſhepheardeſſes found this propoſition ſo reaſonable, that by a common voyce it was enacted; Not (ſayd <hi>Diane</hi> ſmiling) that he be conſtrayned to loue her. For in Loue, Conſtraint can do nothing, and his birth muſt grow from a free will. But I ordayne, that hee ſerue and honour her as you ſay. My Iudge, (anſwered <hi>Siluander)</hi> though you haue condemned mee without hearing me; yet will I not appeale from
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:177519:107"/>
your ſentence: but onely I require, that ſhe whom I muſt ſerue, may merit and know how to acknowledge my ſeruice. <hi>Siluander, Siluander,</hi> (ſayd <hi>Phillis)</hi> becauſe your cunning fayles, you ſeeke out ſtarting-holes: But I will put you beſides all theſe meanes, by her whom I will name: for it is <hi>Diane,</hi> in whom there is wanting neyther ſpirit to know your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nor deſert to giue you will to ſerue her. For my part (anſwered <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uander)</hi> I acknowledge more then you can ſpeake; prouided that it be no profaning of her beauties, to ſerue them for wages. <hi>Diane</hi> would haue ſpoken, and excuſed her ſelfe of this charge; but at the requeſt of <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Astrea,</hi> ſhe conſented, yet with this condition, that this aſſay ſhould laſt but three moneths.</p>
               <p>This buſineſſe being thus ſtayed, <hi>Siluander</hi> caſting himſelfe on his knees, kiſſed the hand of his new miſtriſſe, as if he were to make the oath of his fidelity: and then rayſing himſelfe, Now (ſayd he) that I haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued your ordinance, will you not ſuffer mee (fayre Miſtriſſe) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound vnto you a wrong that hath beene done me? <hi>Diane</hi> anſwered, hee had all liberty. He tooke it agayne thus: If in ſpeaking ouer-much of my merits againſt one that vilified me, I haue iuſtly beene condemned to bring my proofe, why may not this glorious <hi>Phillis,</hi> who is more vaine then I, and who hath beene the cauſe of this diſcourſe, be ſentenced to bring forth a like witneſſe? <hi>Astrea</hi> not ſtaying for <hi>Dianes</hi> anſwere, ſayd, that ſhee tooke this requeſt to be ſo iuſt and honeſt, that ſhee made no queſtion but it ſhould be agreed vnto. And <hi>Diane</hi> hauing demanded the aduice of the Nymph, and ſeeing ſhe was of the ſame opinion, ſentenced the ſhepheardeſſe as he requeſted. I expect not (ſayd <hi>Phillis)</hi> a more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable ſentence, hauing ſuch parties. But well, what muſt I do? You muſt ſeeke to get (ſayd <hi>Siluander)</hi> the fauour of ſome ſhepheard. That is not reaſonable (ſayd <hi>Diane)</hi> for Reaſon is neuer contrary to Duty: but I ordayne, that ſhe ſerue a ſhepheardeſſe; and that as well as you, ſhe be bound to make her loue her: and that party of you two that ſhall be leſſe amiable, at the pleaſure of them whom you ſerue, be compelled to giue place to the other. I will then (ſayd <hi>Phillis)</hi> ſerue <hi>Astrea.</hi> Siſter (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſhe) it ſeemes you doubt of your merit, ſince you goe about a worke done already. But it muſt be the fayre <hi>Diane,</hi> not onely for the two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which you haue alleadged to <hi>Siluander,</hi> which are her merits and her ſpirit: but beſides that, for that ſhe may more equally iudge of the ſeruice both of the one and other, ſo that you muſt addreſſe your ſelfe to her alone.</p>
               <p>This ordinance ſeemed equall to them all, that they ſhould obſerue
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:177519:107"/>
(after they had drawne oath from <hi>Diane,</hi> that without regard of any thing, but the truth, the three moneths being ended, ſhe ſhould deliuer her iudgement.) It was a pleaſure to ſee this new faſhion of loue: for <hi>Phillis</hi> played the ſeruant very well, and <hi>Siluander</hi> in diſſembling, became ſo in good earneſt, as wee will tell you afterwards. <hi>Diane</hi> on the other ſide knew ſo well how to play the miſtriſſe, that there was no body but would haue thought her to be ſo without fayning. As they were in this diſcourſe, and that <hi>Leonide</hi> in her ſelfe had iudged this life to be moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of all others, they ſawe come from the paſtures ſide two ſhepheardeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and three ſhepheards, which by their habits ſhewed to be ſtrangers: and when they were come ſomewhat neerer <hi>Leonide,</hi> who was curious to know the ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes of <hi>Lignon</hi> by their names, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded who they were: whereto <hi>Phillis</hi> anſwered, that they were ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and that ſome moneths are paſſed ſince they came into their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and for her, ſhe knew no more of them. Then <hi>Siluander</hi> added, that ſhee loſt much, in not taking a more particular knowledge of them: for among the reſt there was one named <hi>Hylas,</hi> of as pleaſing an humor, as one would wiſh, for that he loues, as himſelfe ſayes, all that he ſees; but he hath this good with it, that what doth him the hurt, giues him the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy: for that if his inconſtancy make him loue, his inconſtancy likewiſe will make him ſoone forget it, and he will tell you ſuch extrauagant rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, to prooue his humour to be the beſt, that it is impoſſible to heare him without laughter. Truly (ſayd <hi>Leonide)</hi> his company muſt be very delightfull, and we are to put him to his diſcourſe, as ſoone as he comes to vs. That will be (anſwered <hi>Siluander)</hi> without any great labour, for he will talke euerlaſtingly. But as he is of this humour, there is another with him that is of a quite contrary, becauſe he doth nothing but bewaile a dead ſhepheardeſſe whom he loued. This is a very ſtayed man, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to haue iudgement; but withall, he is ſo ſad, that there comes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from his mouth that ſauoureth not of the melancholy of his ſoule. And what is it (replyed <hi>Leonide)</hi> that ſtayes them in this Countrey? To tell you true, ſayd he, I haue not yet beene ſo inquiſitiue: but if you will, I will aske them the queſtion; for mee thinkes they come to vs. At this word they were very neere, ſo that they might heare <hi>Hylas</hi> come chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe Verſes:</p>

That is (ſayd <hi>Siluander)</hi> becauſe he beleeues it is no fault, and ſo glories in it. By this they drew ſo neere, that to ſalute them, the Nymph and the ſhepheard were forced to breake off their ſpeech. And for that <hi>Siluander</hi> kept well in his memory the Nymphs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of the ſtate of theſe ſhepheards, as ſoone as the firſt words of ciui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity were ended, But <hi>Tyrcis</hi> (ſayd <hi>Siluander)</hi> for that was the ſhepheards name, if it be not vnſeaſonable, tell vs the cauſe that made you come into this countrey of <hi>Foreſts,</hi> and what ſtayes you heere? Then <hi>Tyrcis</hi> ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his knee to the earth, and lifting vp his eyes and hands, O infinite Goodnes (ſaid he) that by thy Prouidence gouernes the world, be thou euer prayſed, for that which it hath pleaſed thee to doe to me. And then rayſing vp himſelfe, to the amazement of the Nymph, and all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, he anſwered to <hi>Siluander:</hi> Gentle ſhepheard, you aske me what brought me, and what holdes me in this Countrey? Know, that it is no other then you, and it is you alone, whom I haue ſo long ſought for. Me! (anſwered <hi>Siluander)</hi> how could that be, by reaſon I had no knowledge of you? That is, in part, a cauſe, (ſaid he) why I ſeek you. If it be ſo (repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Siluander)</hi> it is a long while ſince you were with vs; who will ſay that you euerſpake to me? Becauſe (anſwered <hi>Tyrcis)</hi> I know you not; and to ſatisfie the demand you haue made me, for that the diſcourſe is long, if it pleaſe you, I will tell it, after you haue againe taken your places vnder thoſe trees which you had before our comming. <hi>Siluander</hi> then turning to <hi>Diane,</hi> Miſtriſſe (ſayd he) is it your pleaſure to ſit downe agayne? It is, <hi>Leonide</hi> (anſwered <hi>Diane)</hi> of whom you ſhould haue asked that queſtion. I know well, anſwered the ſhepheard, that Ciuility commands me ſo, but Loue ordains it otherwiſe. <hi>Leonide</hi> taking <hi>Diane</hi> and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> by the hand, ſate downe in the middle, ſaying; That <hi>Siluander</hi> had reaſon, becauſe Loue, that hath any other conſideration but of it ſelfe, is no true loue: and after them the other ſhepheardeſſes and ſhepheard ſate in a round.

then <hi>Tyrcis</hi> turning toward the ſhepheardeſſe that was with him; See the happy day (ſaid he) <hi>Laonice,</hi> which we haue ſo much deſired, &amp; that ſince our firſt entry into this Country, we haue expected with ſuch impatiency!

                  <p>OF all friendſhip, there is none (ſo farre as I can heare of) which is more affectionate, then that which is bred in youth, becauſe cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, which this young age takes hold of, by little and little, groweth to be changed into Nature, which if it be hard to put off, they know, that endeuour to contrary it. I ſay this, to ſerue my ſelfe of ſome kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe then (gentle ſhepheard) when you ſee mee conſtrayned to tell you, that I loue <hi>Tyrcis;</hi> for this affection was almoſt ſucked in with the milke; and ſo my ſoule rayſing it ſelfe with this nouriſhment, receiues in her ſelfe (as her owne) the accidents of that paſſion; and it ſeemed, euerything from my birth gaue agreement to it: for wee continued neighbours, the friendſhip betweene our fathers, our ages, which were very euen, and the gentleneſſe of the young yeeres of <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> gaue me but ouer-great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity; yet misfortune would, that much about that time <hi>Cleon</hi> was borne in our Hamlet, which (it may be) had more graces then I, but out of queſtion, with much more better fortune. For euen when this Maide beganne to open her eyes, it ſeemed that <hi>Tyrcis</hi> receiued the flame into his heart, ſeeing that in the very Cradle he tooke pleaſure to behold her.</p>
                  <p>At that time I might be about ſixe yeeres, and he ten yeeres old, and ſee how the heauens diſpoſed of vs without our conſent! From the houre I firſt ſawe him, I loued him; and from the time he ſawe <hi>Cleon,</hi> he loued her: and though our liues were ſuch as our yeeres might beare, yet were they not ſo ſmall, but there might very well be found the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs. Afterward, as we grew, ſo did our loue likewiſe, and that to ſuch an extraordinary height, as (it may be) there was not any that might ſurpaſſe it.</p>

power to make me diſſemble: and if I could not indeed withdraw my ſelfe intirely; yet, at leaſt, make ſhew to take ſome kinde of leaue. That which tooke from me all meanes to doe it, was, that I could not ſee that <hi>Tircis</hi> affected any other ſhepheardeſſe; for all that he did to <hi>Cleon,</hi> could not mooue ſuſpition that it was any thing but childiſhneſſe, for that as then ſhe could not be aboue nine yeeres old: &amp; when ſhe began to grow, and that ſhe could feele the tracts of Loue, ſhe ſo remooued from him, that it ſeemed, that this withdrawing would haue warranted her againſt all ſuch blowes. But Loue, more crafty then ſhee, knew ſo well to come neere, and ſet before her ſoule, the merits, the affection, and the ſeruices of <hi>Tircis,</hi> that at laſt, ſhee found her ſelfe in the very middeſt, and ſo turned on all parts, that if ſhe auoyded wounding on the one ſide, the ſtroke that ſhe receiued on the other, was the greater and more deepe: So that ſhee could not flie to a better remedy then diſſimulation; not to auoyde the blowes, but onely to keepe it from the knowledge of her enemy, or any other. She might well vſe this diſſembling, while it beganne to be but a little ſcratch; but when the ſore became great, then muſt ſhee yeelde and confeſſe her ſelfe to be vanquiſhed. Thus you ſee <hi>Tircis</hi> beloued of <hi>Cleon,</hi> and behold him playing with the honeſt ſweetneſſe of an amity, though at the beginning he ſcarce knew what his diſeaſe was, as theſe verſes wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, which he made at that time:</p>

                  <p>After <hi>Tircis</hi> had knowledge of the good will of happy <hi>Cleon,</hi> he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it with ſo great contentment, that his heart beeing vnable to hide it, he was forced to impart it to his eyes; which God knowes, how ſuddain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed from that they were, gaue but too manifeſt knowledge of their ioy. The diſcretion of <hi>Cleon</hi> was ſuch, that ſhee gaue no aduantage to <hi>Tircis</hi> for his duty: ſo that iealouſie of her honor perſwaded her to make ſhew of louing me, that they which noted her actions, might ſtop at thoſe which were more euident; and goe no further to ſeeke out thoſe which ſhe would conceale. She made choyce of mee rather then any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that ſhe had long before perceiued that I loued him: and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, it is hard to be beloued, and not to loue againe, ſhe thought that euery body would beleeue, that this friendſhip, not hauing bene long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs, might be thought to grow from the good will which I bare him.</p>
                  <p>He that had no deſigne, but that which <hi>Cleon</hi> allowed, preſently ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoured to effect that which ſhee had commanded him. O God, when I remember the ſweete words which he vſed to me, I cannot (though they were lyes) containe my ſelfe from entertaining them; and thanke Loue for thoſe happy moments, wherewith he delighted me at thoſe times; and wiſh, ſince I cannot be more happy, that I might at leaſt, bee alwaies ſo deceiued. And indeed, <hi>Tircis</hi> found it no great paine to perſwade mee, that he loued me: for beſides, that euery one eaſly beleeues the thing they deſire, me thought it might haue bin ſo, becauſe I did not iudge my ſelfe to be ſo vnlouely, but that ſo long a conuerſing as ours was, might haue gayned ſomewhat of him; eſpecially with the care I had to pleaſe him. Whereby this glorious <hi>Cleon</hi> oftentimes paſſed the time with him: but if Loue had bin iuſt, he ſhuld haue made the deceit fal on her ſelf, by ſuffring <hi>Tircis</hi> to come &amp; loue me vnfainedly: yet it fell not out ſo, but contrarily, this diſſimulation was ſo vnſupportable, that he could not continue it: and did not Loue ſhut vp the eyes of them that loue, I could not chuſe but haue perceiued it, as wel as the greater part of them that ſaw vs together; to whom, as to my profeſſed enemies, I would giue no credit: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Cleon</hi> &amp; I were very familiar, this cunning ſhepheardeſſe feared, that time, &amp; the ſight I had, might put me out of the errour wherein I was. But ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle ſhepherd, it had bin neceſſary that I had bin as forecaſting as ſhe: yet the better to hide herſelfe, ſhe inuented a ſleight, which was not euill. Her
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:177519:110"/>
purpoſe, as I haue told you, was to ſhadow the loue which <hi>Tircis</hi> bare her, by that which hee made ſhew of to me: and it ſucceeded as ſhee ſet downe, for they beganne to talke ſomewhat loude, and to my diſaduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and though it were but they that looked no further then to appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, yet this nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber being greater then the other, the bruit ran preſently, and the ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they had before of <hi>Cleon,</hi> died at that inſtant; ſo that I may ſay, that ſhe loued at my coſt. But ſhe that feared, as I told you, leſt I ſhould come to diſcouer the practice, would cloke it vnder another; and counſelled <hi>Tircis</hi> to let me know, that euery body beganne to finde out our loue, and to cenſure it ſhrowdly enough, and that it was neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to cauſe it to ceaſe by wiſedome, and that it was fit he ſhould ſeeme to loue <hi>Cleon,</hi> that by this diuerting, they which talked the worſt, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelues. And you may tell her, ſaid ſhe, that you haue choſen me rather then any other, for the commodity you haue to be neere her, and to ſpeake to her. I, that was all honeſt, and without craft, found this counſell good, ſo that (with my permiſſion) from that day, when we three were together, he made not dainty to entertaine <hi>Cleon</hi> as he was accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And indeed, it was very pleaſing to them, and to any other that knew this diſſimulation: for, ſeeing the ſuite that hee made to <hi>Cleon,</hi> I thought he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſted, and could hardly hold my ſelfe from laughter. On the other ſide, <hi>Cleon</hi> noting my faſhions, and knowing the deceit wherein I thought her to be, was extremely pained to diſſemble it; eſpecially, when this crafty companion made certaine winks with her eye, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were ſo farre from the purpoſe, that I might accuſe the loue ſhee bare to the ſhepherd, and the contentment that this deceit brought him. And ſee if I were in my right minde, that of pitty I felt the diſpleaſure which ſhe ſhould haue, when ſhe knew the truth! But ſince I found, that I complaine in her perſon, yet may I excuſe my ſelfe; for who hath not beene beguiled, ſince that Loue, as ſoone as he gets intire poſſeſſion of a ſoule, ſpoyles it preſently of all diſtruſt in the perſon beloued? And this diſſembling ſhepheard played his part ſo well, that if I had beene in <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> place (it may bee) I ſhould haue doubted his ſhewes had beene true.</p>
                  <p>Being ſometimes in the middle betweene vs two, if hee laboured to make ouer-great demonſtration of his loue to <hi>Cleon,</hi> hee would inſtantly turne to me, and aske me in mine care, if he had not done well. But his maſter-fraud ſtucke not at ſo ſmall a thing: heare you, I beſeech you, whereto it paſſed. In priuate he ſpake more often to <hi>Cleon,</hi> then to mee; he would kiſſe her hand; he would bee an houre or two on his knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:177519:111"/>
her, and would not conceale it from me, for the cauſe I haue told you: but generally he would neuer budge from me; ſued to me with ſuch diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, that the greateſt part held on the opinion they formerly had of our loues; which he did of purpoſe, deſirous, that I onely ſhould ſee his courting of her, becauſe hee knew well I would not beleeue it: but hee would not in any caſe, that they, who might iudge rightly, ſhould come to the leaſt knowledge. And when I told him, we could not put out of mens heads the opinion of our loue, and that none would beleeue it, when it was told me that he loued <hi>Cleon:</hi> How (anſwered he) will you haue them beleeue a thing that is not? So it is, that our plots, in deſpite of the worſt conceits, ſhall be beleeued in generall. But he, that was well aduiſed, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an occaſion preſented to paſſe yet further, ſayd to mee, That aboue all, we muſt deceiue <hi>Cleon;</hi> and if ſhe were once deceiued, we had then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt accompliſhed our purpoſe; that for this cauſe, of neceſſity, I muſt ſpeake to her for him, and I ſhould doe it confidently.</p>
                  <p>She (ſaith he) that already hath this opinion, will with all her heart, receiue thoſe meſſages which you bring her, and ſo we ſhall liue in aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Oh! what a miſerable fortune doe we oftentimes runne into? for my part, I thought that if at any time <hi>Cleon</hi> beleeued that I loued this ſhepheard, I ſhould make her loſe that opinion, when I prayed her to loue him, and confidently ſpake for him. But <hi>Cleon</hi> knowing what ſpeech I had with the ſhepheard: and ſeeing in what reſtraint ſhe liued, iudged ſhe might by my meanes haue meſſages, and eſpecially letters. This was the cauſe that ſhe tooke in good part the propoſition which I made her; and from that time ſhe treated with him as with the man ſhe loued and I ſerued to no other vſe, than to carry letters from the one to the other. O Loue! to what an occupation didſt thou then put me? Yet may I not complayne, for that I haue heard ſay, that I am not tho firſt that haue done ſuch offices to others, thinking to worke for themſelues.</p>
                  <p>About that time, becauſe the Frankes, Romans, Gothes and Burgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians rayſed a cruell warre, we were conſtrayned to go into the Towne, which beares the name of that ſhepheard that was Iudge to the three god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes; for our place of abode was not farre from thence, vpon the banks of the great riuer of <hi>Seyne.</hi> And for that by reaſon of the great acceſſe of people, which from all parts came to withdraw them there, and the want of thoſe commodities which they were vſed vnto in the Champaine, the contagious ſickeneſſe beganne to take ſo violent a courſe throughout the Towne, that euen the great men could nor defend themſelues. It fell out that the mother of <hi>Cleon</hi> was attaynted with it. And although that this

diſeaſe were ſo fearefull, that there was neither parentage, nor obligation of loue, that could retayne the ſound about them that were infected; yet the good nature of <hi>Cleon</hi> had ſuch power ouer her, that ſhe would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her mother, whatſoeuer ſhe ſayd vnto her: but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On this reſolution ſhe would neuer abandon her mother: and ſtaying with her, ſerued her as freely, as if it had beene no infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. <hi>Tyrcis</hi> was all the day long at their doore, burning with deſire to enter into their lodging; but the for bidding of <hi>Cleon</hi> ſtayed him, who would not ſuffer him, for feare leſt they that were ready to thinke the worſt, might iudge his preſence preiudiciall to her chaſtity. He that would not diſpleaſe her, not daring to enter, cauſed to be carried to them all things neceſſary, with ſo great care, that they were neuer in want of any thing. Yet (as the heauens would) this happy <hi>Cleon</hi> would not eſcape the infectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of her mothers diſeaſe, whatſoeuer preſeruatiues <hi>Tyrcis</hi> could bring. When this ſhepheard knew it, it was no more poſſible to keepe him backe from entring into their lodging, thinking it was now no time to diſſemble, nor to feare the biting of the bad-ſpeaker. He then ſet in order all his affayres, diſpoſed of his goods, and declared his laſt will: then hauing left a charge to ſome of his friends, to ſend him ſuccour, he ſhuts himſelfe in with the mother and the daughter, reſoluing to runne the ſame fortune that <hi>Cleon</hi> did. It would ſerue to no purpoſe, but to lengthen the diſcourſe, to tell you, what were the good offices, what the ſeruices that he did to the mother, for the conſideration of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for he could not imagine more then thoſe which his affection made him performe.</p>
                  <p>But when he ſawe her dead, and that there remayned no more then his Miſtris, whoſe diſeaſe growing worſe and worſe, I do not thinke that this ſhepheard reſted one moment. He <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Shee on the other ſide, who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes loued him ſo dearely, acknowledged ſo great loue in this laſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that her owne was much increaſed, ſo that one of her griefes was, the danger wherein ſhe ſaw him for her cauſe. He on the contrary ſide, tooke ſuch ſatisfaction, that Fortune (though his enemy) yet had offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him this meane, to giue teſtimony of his goodwill, that he could not
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:177519:112"/>
giue her thankes enow. If fell out, that the diſeaſe of this ſhepheardeſſe (being in caſe needfull to be launced) there was no Surgeon that would (for feare of danger) hazzard himſelfe to touch her. <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> whoſe affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction found nothing hard, being inſtructed what he was to doe, tooke the launcer, and lifting vp her arme, launced it, and dreſſed it without feare. Shortly (gentle ſhepheard) all the moſt dangerous things and moſt noyſome, were ſweet vnto him, and very caſie. So it was, that the diſeaſe hourely encreaſing, brought this Nymph (beloued <hi>Cleon)</hi> to that eſtate, that there remayned no more ſtrength, but to ſpeake theſe words: I am ſorry that the gods will no longer draw out the threed of my life, not that I haue a deſire to liue longer time; for this deſire can neuer make me wiſh it, hauing had triall of the diſcommodities which follow mortals: but onely, that (in ſome ſort) I would not die ſo much obliged to you, but that I might haue time to giue you teſtimony, that I am not attainted with Ingratitude, nor miſpriſing. It is true, that when I conſider what are the obligations which I owe you, I thinke the heauens are right iuſt, to take me out of the world, ſince that if I ſhould liue as many ages as I haue done dayes, I know not how to ſatisfie the leaſt of that infinite number which your affection hath brought forth. Receiue then for all that which I owe you, not an equall good, but indeed, all that I can, which is an oath which I make you, that euen death ſhall neuer wipe out the memory of your loue, nor the deſire I haue to make all the acknowledgements that a true louing perſon may yeeld to him, to whom ſhe is bound. Theſe words were vttered with much payne, but the loue ſhe bare the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard gaue her the ſtrength to deliuer them. Whereto <hi>Tyrcis</hi> anſwered (Faire Miſtris) I can hardly thinke I haue bound you, nor that euer I ſhall, becauſe that which I haue hitherto done, hath not ſatisfied my ſelfe: and whereas you ſay, you are obliged to me, I ſee well, you know not the greatnes of the loue of <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> otherwiſe you would not thinke, that ſo ſmall a thing was able to pay the tribute of ſo great duty. Beleeue mee (fayre <hi>Cleon)</hi> the fauour you haue done me, ſo kindely to receiue the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices which you ſay I haue done you, charge me with ſo great a burden, that a thouſand liues, and a thouſand ſuch occaſions know not how to diſcharge me.</p>
                  <p>The heauens which haue cauſed me to be borne but for you, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me of miſpriſall, if I liue not for you: and if I haue any deſſigne to employ one ſingle moment of this life, other then to your ſeruice. He would haue held on longer, but the ſhepheardeſſe (ouerladen with her ſickeneſſe) interrupted him, Ceaſe, friend, and let me ſpeake, to the end,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:177519:112"/>
that the ſmall remainder of my life may be employed, in aſſuring you, that you may not be better beloued, than you are of me, who finding my ſelfe ready to depart, giue you an eternall farewell, and intreate you for three things, alwayes to loue <hi>Cleon;</hi> to cauſe mee to be buryed neere my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bones; and to take order, that when you are to pay the duety of mortality, your body be layed neere mine, that I may reſt with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment, that not hauing the power to be vnited to you in life, yet I may be ſo at leaſt in death. He anſwered, The gods ſhould be vniuſt, if hauing giuen beginning to ſo good an amity as ours, they ſhould ſunder it ſo ſoone. I hope they will yet preſerue you, or at leaſt, they will take me away before you, if they haue any compaſſion of the afflicted: but if they will not, I onely deſire of them ſo much life, as may ſatisfie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements which you make me, and then permit me to follow you, that if they cut not off my threed, and my hand be free, aſſure your ſelfe (fayre Miſtris) you ſhall not be long without me. Friend (anſwered ſhe) I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyne you beyond this, to liue as long as the gods pleaſe; for in the length of your life, they ſhall ſhew themſelues pittifull vnto vs, ſince that by this meanes I ſhall make relation in the <hi>Eliſian</hi> fields of our perfect amity, you may publiſh it to the liuing: and ſo the dead and liuing men ſhall honour our memory. But friend, I perceiue, my diſeaſe enforces me to leaue you; farewell, the moſt louely, and the beſt beloued among men. At theſe laſt words ſhe dyed, leaning her head on the boſome of her ſhepheard.</p>
                  <p>To tell you the diſpleaſure hee tooke, and the complaynts hee made, were but to ſtrike the ſword deeper into the wound; beſides that, his gaſhes are yet ſo open, that euery man ſeeing them, may well iudge what the blowes were. O death, cryed <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> that haſt robbed me of the better part of my ſelfe! either reſtore me that thou haſt taken, or take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the reſt. And then, to giue roome to teares and ſighes, which this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance pluckt from his heart, he held his peace for a while: when <hi>Siluander</hi> told him, he was to reſolue himſelfe, ſince there was no remedy: and that for things happened, and may no more be, complaints were but witneſſes of weakeneſſe. So much the rather (ſayd <hi>Tyrcis)</hi> find I occaſion of complaynt: for if there were any remedy, it were not the part of a man aduiſed, or one of courage, to complayne; but he may be well allowed to bewaile that, which can find no other aſſwagement. Then <hi>Laonice</hi> taking agayne her ſpeech, continued in this ſort: At laſt this happy ſhepheardeſſe being dead, and <hi>Tyrcis</hi> hauing rendred the laſt offices of loue, hee tooke order ſhe ſhould be buryed by her mother, but the ignorance of them to whom he gaue the charge, was ſuch, that they placed her elſe-where: for
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:177519:113"/>
as for him, he was ſo afflicted, as he ſtirred not from off his bed, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingnothing to preſerue his life, but the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements ſhe had giuen him. Somes dayes after, enquiring of thoſe who came to viſit him, in what place the body ſo beloued was layed, hee knew it was not by her mother; whereat he conceiued ſuch a diſpleaſure, that contracting for a great ſumme with thoſe that vſed to bury, they promiſed to take her vp, and to lay her with her mother. And indeed they went about it, and hauing opened the ground, they tooke her vp betweene three or foure of them; but hauing carryed her a little way, the infection was ſo great, that they were compelled to leaue her in mid-way, reſolued rather to die, then to carry her furder.</p>
                  <p>Where of <hi>Tyrcis</hi> being aduertiſed, after he had made them yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter offers, and ſeeing they would not reſpect it: And why (ſayd he aloud) canſt thou hope, that the loue of gayne may do more in them, than thine in thee? Ah <hi>Tyrcis!</hi> this is too great an offence to thy Loue. Hee ſpake thus, and as one tranſported, he runnes to the place where the body was, and though it had beene three dayes buryed, and that the ſtinke was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, yet tooke he it betweene his armes, and carryed it to her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers graue, which was by that time couered. And after ſo good a deed, and ſo great a teſtimony of his affection, withdrawing himſelfe out of the Towne, he ſtayed forty nights ſeparated from all men. Now all theſe things were vnknowne to me, for one of my Aunts being ſicke of the like diſeaſe (almoſt) at that time, we conuerſed not with any: and the ſame day that he came backe, I returned like wiſe. Hauing vnderſtood onely of the death of <hi>Cleon,</hi> I went to him to know the particularities; but comming to his chamber doore, I layd mine eye to the key-hole, becauſe I came neere, I heard him ſigh: and I was not deceiued, for I ſaw him on his bed, his eyes lifted to heauen-ward, his hands ioyned together, and his face couered with teares. If I were aſtoniſhed (gentle ſhepheard) iudge you; for I did not thinke he had loued her, and came (in part) to delight my ſelfe with him. At laſt, after I had beheld him ſome while, with a ſigh which ſeemed to part his ſtomake in pieces, I heard him bring foorth theſe words:</p>

                  <p>O gods! what became of me when I heard him ſpeake thus? my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement was ſuch, that vnawares leaning againſt the doore, I entred but halfe in, whereat he turned his head; and ſeeing me, he made none other ſigne, but holding out his hand to me, prayed me to ſit on the bed by him: and then wiping his eyes, for ſo he ſhould alwayes need an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kercher, hee ſpake to mee in this ſort: Well, <hi>Laonice,</hi> the poore <hi>Cleon</hi> is dead, and we are left to bewayle her rauiſhment. And becauſe the paine I was in, gaue me no power to anſwer, he went onward: I know well (ſhepheardeſſe) that ſeeing me in this plight for <hi>Cleon,</hi> you are amazed, that the fayned loue I bare her ſhould giue me ſo true feelings. But alas! leaue that errour, I beſeech you, ſo me thinkes I ſhould commit a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fault againſt Loue, if without cauſe I ſhould hold on that diſſembling, whereto my affection (till now) commaunded me: Know then <hi>Laonice,</hi> that I haue loued <hi>Cleon,</hi> and that all other ſuites were but to cloake that;
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:177519:114"/>
and if you did euer beare me friendſhip, for Gods ſake, <hi>Laonice,</hi> condole with me this diſaſter, that at once haue layd all my hopes in her coffin. And if you be in any ſort offended, pardon <hi>Tyrcis</hi> the errour which hee hath committed againſt you, that he might not be wanting in that which was due to <hi>Cleon.</hi> At theſe words, tranſported with choler, I went away (ſo farre beſides my ſelfe) that I could hardly finde out my lodging, from whence I ſtirred not of a long time. But after wee haue croſſed Loue a thouſand times, yet muſt we ſubmit our ſelues: and therfore, behold me as much to <hi>Tyrcis</hi> as euer I was. I excuſe in my ſelfe, the treaſons which he had done me, and pardon him the wrongs and faynings where with hee offended me, naming them, in pardoning them, not diſſemblings nor treaſons, but violences of loue. And I was the eaſlyer drawne vnto this pardon, for the Loue, who profeſſeth himſelfe a party in this fault, went flattring me with a certaine hope to ſucceed in <hi>Cleons</hi> place. While I was in this thought, behold, one of my ſiſters came to tell me, that <hi>Tyrcis</hi> was loſt, ſo that he was no more to be ſeene, and no body knew where he was.</p>
                  <p>This recharge of griefe ſurprized me ſo forcibly, that all that I could do, was to tel her, that this ſadnes being ouer-paſſed, he would returne as he went. But from that time I reſolued to follow him, and that I might not be hindered by any, I got out ſo ſecretly, about the beginning of the night, that before day I found my ſelfe farre off. If I were aſtoniſhed at the firſt, ſeeing my ſelfe alone in the darke, the heauens know it, to whom my complaints were directed; but Loue, which ſecretly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed me, gaue me courage enough to accompliſh my purpoſe. So I purſued my voyage, following (without more adoe) the way which my ſeet met with, for I knew not whither <hi>Tyrcis</hi> went, nor my ſelfe neither. So that I was a wandere more than foure moneths, hearing no newes of him. At laſt, p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And for that my cuſtome was to demaund newes of <hi>Tyrcis</hi> of all I met, I addreſſed my ſelfe to the place where I ſawe them, and knew that my ſhepheard (by the marks they had giuen me) was in thoſe deſerts: and that he went alwayes bewayling <hi>Cleon.</hi> Then I told them what I tell you, and coniured them to tell me the moſt certayne newes they could.

<pb n="523" facs="tcp:177519:114"/>
of her griefes, by which I found that Loue ſtrikes as well in the Court as in our woods: and for that our fortunes had ſome ſympathy betwixt them, ſhe deſired me to tarry and end our iourny together, ſince we both made one kind of ſearch. I that was alone receiued (with open armes) this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity; and from that time we parted not aſunder. But what ſerues this diſcourſe to my purpoſe, ſince I will onely relate to you what concernes <hi>Tyrcis</hi> and me? Gentle ſhepheard, this ſhall be enough, to ſay to you, that after we had ſtayed more then three moneths in that country, at laſt, we knew he was come hither: where we no ſooner arriued, but that I met him, and ſo vnſeaſonably for him, that he ſtood as amazed. At the firſt he receiued me with a countenance good enough: but at laſt, knowing the occaſion of my voyage, he declared to me all at length, the extreme af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection he bare vnto <hi>Cleon:</hi> and that it was not in his power to loue me. Loue (if there be any iuſtice in thee) I demaund of thee, and not of this ingratefull, ſome acknowledgement of ſo much trauell paſſed.</p>
                  <p>So ended <hi>Laonice,</hi> and ſeeming ſhe had no more to ſay, wiping her eyes, ſhe turned them pittifully to <hi>Siluander,</hi> as asking fauour, in the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of her cauſe. Then <hi>Tyrcis</hi> ſpake in this ſort: Wiſe ſhepheard, though the hiſtory of my misfortunes be ſuch as this ſhepheardeſſe hath told you, yet is the ſtory of my griefes much more pittifull, wherewith yet I will entertayne you no longer, for feare of troubling you and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, onely I will adde to that which ſhe hath ſayd, that not being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to endure her ordinary complaints (by common conſent) we went to the Oracle, to know what he would ordayne of vs, and we had ſuch an anſwer by the mouth of <hi>Arontyne:</hi>

                  <p>IF I were to maintaine the cauſe of <hi>Laonice,</hi> before a perſon vnnaturall, I would feare (it may be) leſt the want of my capacity, might leſſen in ſome ſort, the iuſtice which is in it: but ſince it is before you, gentle ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, that haue the heart of a man; I meane, which know what the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are of an honeſt man, I not onely not miſtruſt a fauourable iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but hold for certaine, that if you were in the roome of <hi>Tircis,</hi> you would be aſhamed to be noted for ſuch an error. I will hold my ſelfe then from ſeeking out more reaſons for this cauſe, which is ſo cleere of it ſelfe, that all other light would ſerue but for a ſhaddow: and I will onely ſay, that the name which he beares of man, ties him to the contrary of that he doth, and that the lawes and ordinances of heauen, and of nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to diſpute no longer about this cauſe. Doe not the duties of courteſie ordaine to render good turnes receiued? Doe not the heauens command, that for enery ſeruice ſome reward ſhould bee giuen? And doth not Nature conſtraine to loue a fayre woman that loues him, and to abhorre, rather then to cheriſh a dead body? But this quite contrary;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:177519:115"/>
for the fauors receiued of <hi>Laonice,</hi> he renders diſcourteſie; and in ſtead of ſeruices, which himſelfe confeſſes ſhe hath done him, ſeruing him ſo long vnder the couerture of <hi>Cleons</hi> loue, he payes her with ingratitude; and for the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which ſhe hath borne him from her cradle, he makes no ſhew but of miſpriſall. Are you ſo honeſt a man, <hi>Tircis,</hi> and doe you ſo ſeeme to know the gods? and yet me thinkes, this ſhepheardeſſe is ſuch an one, that were it not that her influence eaſts her into misfortune, it were more proper for her to make others feele, then for her ſelfe to feele the wrongs where of ſhe complaines. If thou beeſt a man, knoweſt thou not that it is proper to a man to loue the liuing and not the dead? And if thou acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the gods, knoweſt thou not that they can puniſh them that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their ordinances? and that,
<q>

                  <p>If thou confeſſeſt, that from the cradle ſhe hath ſerued thee, and loued thee, O God, ſhall it be poſſible, that ſo long an affection, and ſo pleaſing ſeruices, ſhould, at laſt, be payd with contempt?</p>
                  <p>But be it that this affection, and theſe ſeruices, being voluntary in <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> and not ſought for of <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> may weigh little with an ingratefull ſoule; yet will I not beleeue that you will award (O iuſt <hi>Siluander!)</hi> but that the deceiuer is to giue ſatisfaction to the party deceiued: and as <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis</hi> (by his diſſimulation) hath ſo long time deluded this fayre ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, ſhall he not be bound to repayre this iniury to her, with as much true affection, as he hath made her take lies and falſhoodes? that if euery one ought to loue his like, will not you (our Iudge) ordayne, that <hi>Tyrcis</hi> loue a perſon liuing, and not one dead, and place his loue there where he may liue, and not among the cold a ſhes in a coffin? But <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> tell mee, what may be thy deſſigne? after thou haſt met with a floud of teares, the ſad relickes of the poore <hi>Cleon,</hi> thinkeſt thou that thou canſt rayſe her vp agayne with thy fighes and teares? Alas! they pay <hi>Caron</hi> but once, and they neuer but once enter into his boate: You may well call her backe from thence, but he is deafe to ſuch cryes, and neuer ſendeth out perſon that comes aboord him. It is impiety <hi>(Tyrcis)</hi> to goe about tormenting the reſt of thoſe whom the gods call away. Loue is ordayned for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, and the Coffin for thoſe that are dead. Deſire not to confound their ordinances (in ſuch ſort) that to a dead <hi>Cleon</hi> thou giue a liuing affection; and to a quicke <hi>Laonice,</hi> a graue. And herein doe not arme thy ſelfe with the name of Conſtancy, for it hath no right to it. Doſt thou thinke it fit, that a man ſhould go naked, becauſe he hath worne out his firſt garments?

                     <hi>Cleon</hi> is dead, thou wilt neuer loue more.

And you (wiſe ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) that knowes better what I ſhould ſpeake in her defence than I can conceiue, ſupply the wants which are in me, by the abundance of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are in my cauſe; and to beginne, I will ſay, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that all the reaſons which thou haſt alledged to prooue, that beeing beloued, one ought to loue, though they be falſe, yet they are agreed vpon for good: but wherefore wilt thou conclude by it, that <hi>Tyrcis</hi> muſt leaue the loue of <hi>Cleon,</hi> to beginne a new with <hi>Laonice?</hi> Thou demaundeſt things impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and contraries; impoſſible, becauſe no man is bound to do more than he can: and how wouldſt thou haue my ſhepheard loue, if hee haue no will? Thou laugheſt, <hi>Hylas,</hi> when thou heareſt me ſay, that hee hath none. It is true (interrupted <hi>Hylas)</hi> what hath he done with it? He that loueth (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> hath giuen his very ſoule to the perſon beloued, and the will is but one power. But (replyed <hi>Hylas)</hi> this <hi>Cleon</hi> to whom you would he ſhould be ſent, being dead, hath nothing remaining of a perſon, and ſo <hi>Tircis</hi> is to take that againe which was his. Ah! <hi>Hylas, Hylas</hi> (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> you ſpeake as if Loue were a Nouice: for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which are made by his authority, are alwaies irreuocable. And what (reioyned <hi>Hylas)</hi> ſhall become of this will ſince the death of <hi>Cleon?</hi> This little loſſe (ſaid ſhe) hath followed that great extreme loſſe which he had in loſing her: for that if pleaſure be the obiect of the will, ſince now he can haue no more pleaſure, what hath he to doe with will? and it hath followed <hi>Cleon</hi> ſo, that if <hi>Cleon</hi> be no more, no more is his will, for he neuer had it but for her: but if <hi>Cleon</hi> be yet in any place, as the Dru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ides teach vs, this will is in her hands, ſo content to be in that place, that

And this being ſo, why accuſe you the faithfull <hi>Tircis</hi> of ingratitude, if it be not in his power to loue elſewhere? And ſee, how you command, not onely a thing impoſſible, but contrary to it ſelfe: for if euery one bee bound to loue that that loues him, why will you not that he loue <hi>Cleon,</hi> who neuer fayled in loue to him? And as for the recompences which you demand for the ſeruices, and for the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which <hi>Laonice</hi> carried from one to the other, let her remember the contentment which ſhe receiued; &amp; how many happy daies ſhe paſſed, before this deceit, which otherwiſe ſhe ſhould haue ſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t miferably: let her ballance her ſeruices with that payment, &amp; I aſſure myſelfe, ſhee ſhall bee found their debtor. Thou ſaiſt, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that <hi>Tircis</hi> hath be guiled her. This is no beguiling, but a iuſt puniſhment of Loue, that hath made her blowes fall on her owne ſelfe, ſince her purpoſe was not to ſerue, but to delude the wiſe <hi>Cleon;</hi> that if ſhe haue cauſe to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaine of any thing, it is, that of two deceyuers, ſhe hath beene the leſſe crafty.

Me thinks I ſee her in the midſt of vs clothed with immortality, in ſtead of a frayle body, and ſubiect to all accidents; which reproches <hi>Hylas</hi> for the blaſphemies which he hath vſed againſt her. And what wilt thou anſwer, <hi>Hylas,</hi> if the happy <hi>Cleon</hi> ſay to thee; Thou (inconſtant) wouldſt trayne vp my <hi>Tyrcis</hi> in thy vnfaithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: if he haue heeretofore loued me, thinkeſt thou it was my body? if thou ſayſt, Yes: I anſwer, He ought to be condemned (ſince no louer is euer to withdraw himſelfe from a loue begunne) to loue the aſhes which I haue left him in my coffin, ſo long as they endure. If hee confeſſe he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my ſpirit, that is my principall part; then why (inconſtant) will hee change that will at this time, when it is more perfect than euer it was? Heeretofore (ſo will the miſery of the liuing haue it) I might be iealous, I might be importunate, I muſt ſerue, I was marked by more then him, but now freed from all imperfections, I am no more capable to beare his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>And thou <hi>Hylas,</hi> thou wouldſt with thy ſacrilegious inuentions turne from me, him in whom onely I liue in earth, and by a cruelty more bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous than hath beene heard of, aſſay to lay on me another death. Wiſe <hi>Siluander,</hi> the words which I deliuer, ſound ſo ſenſibly in mine eares, that I doe not thinke but you heare them, and feele them at your heart. This is the cauſe, that to leaue this diuinity ſpeaking in your ſoule, I will hold my peace, after I haue onely told you, that loue is ſo iuſt, that you are to feare the puniſhments in your ſelues, if the pitty of <hi>Laonice,</hi> rather than the reaſon of <hi>Cleon,</hi> moue and carry you. At this word, <hi>Phillis</hi> riſing with a curteous reuerence, made ſigne ſhe would ſay no more for <hi>Tyrcis.</hi> When <hi>Laonice</hi> would haue made an anſwer, <hi>Siluander</hi> forbade it, ſaying; It was not now time to defend her ſelfe, but to heare onely the ſentence which the gods pronounced by his mouth: and after he had ſome while conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with himſelfe the reaſons of them both, hee pronounced ſuch a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence:</p>

                  <p>THe principall poynt of the cauſes debated before vs, is, to know if Loue may die by the death of the thing beloued? Whereupon wee ſay, that a loue that may periſh, is no true loue; for it ought to follow the ſubiect that gaue it birth: Therefore it is, that they which loue the body onely, muſt encloſe all their loues of the body in the ſame tombe
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:177519:117"/>
where it is ſhut vp; but they that beyond this, loue the ſpirit, ought with their loues to flie after this beloued ſoule to the higheſt heauens, no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being able to ſeparate them. Therefore, all theſe things well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we ordayne, That <hi>Tyrcis</hi> alwayes loue his <hi>Cleon,</hi> and that of the two loues which may be in vs, the one ſhall follow the body of <hi>Cleon</hi> to the tombe, and the other the ſpirit into heauen. In like ſort, it is ordered, That ſuites of <hi>Laonice</hi> be forbidden, that ſhee no longer diſquiet the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of <hi>Cleon;</hi> for ſuch is the will of the gods that ſpeakes in me.</p>
                  <p>Hauing ſayd thus, without regarding the complaynts and reproches which he foreſawe in <hi>Laonice</hi> and <hi>Hylas,</hi> hee made a great reuerence to <hi>Leonide,</hi> and the reſt of the company, and ſo went away without other companion than <hi>Phillis,</hi> who would ſtay no longer to heare the ſorrowes of this ſhepheardeſſe. And becauſe it was late, <hi>Leonide</hi> withdrew into the Hamlet of <hi>Diane,</hi> for that night; and the ſhepheards and ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, as they were accuſtomed (except <hi>Laonice)</hi> who infinitely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with <hi>Siluander</hi> and <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſware not to goe out of that Countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe had done them ſome notable diſpleaſure; it ſeemed that For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune brought her as ſhee could haue wiſhed. For, hauing left that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and being placed in the thickeſt of the wood, to mourne at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, at the laſt, her good ſpirit ſet before her eyes the inſupportable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of <hi>Tyrcis,</hi> how much vnworthy he was to be beloued of her, and made her ſo aſhamed of her fault, that a thouſand times ſhe ſware to hate him, and for his cauſe, <hi>Siluander</hi> and <hi>Phillis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It fell out while theſe things thus paſſed in her memory, that <hi>Licidas,</hi> which ſome dayes before beganne to be euill ſatisfied with <hi>Phillis,</hi> by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of ſome coldneſſe, which he thought he found in her, perceiued <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uander</hi> to come talking with her. It was true, that the ſhepheardeſſe vſed more coldneſſe towards him, or rather, want of heate, then ſhe had done before ſhe frequented the company of <hi>Diane,</hi> for that this new friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the pleaſure that <hi>Astrea, Diane,</hi> and ſhe tooke together, ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed her, that ſhe no more heeded thoſe ſmall wanton trickes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the affection of <hi>Licidas</hi> was nouriſhed, and hee which knew well, that a loue cannot build vp it ſelfe, but with the ruine of the former, was of opinion, that that which made her more luke-warme towards him, and leſſe carefull to entertayne him, was ſome new amity, which turned her aſide. And not being able to know who was the ſubiect, hee went all alone gnawing vpon his thoughts, and withdrew into the moſt couert places, that he might complayne to himſelfe with moſt liberty, and by
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:177519:118"/>
miſ-hap, when he was minded to returne, he ſawe (as I told you) <hi>Siluan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> come along: a ſight that brought him no ſmall ſuſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion. For knowing the worth of the ſhepheard and of the ſhepheardeſſe, he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſuppoſed that <hi>Siluander,</hi> hauing neuer yet loued any, was now giuen to her, and that ſhe following the humor of thoſe of her Sex, had willingly enough receiued the donation. All theſe conſiderations gaue him much ſuſpition, but much rather, when paſſing by him, without ſeeing him, he heard, or he thought he heard the words of loue; and that may well be, by reaſon of the ſentence which <hi>Siluander</hi> came from giuing.</p>
                  <p>But to put him out of all patience, it fell out, that ſuffering them to paſſe by, he went from the place he was in; and that he might not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, he tooke the way they had come: and fortune would, that he went to ſit downe, neere the place where <hi>Laonice</hi> was, not ſeeing her. Where, after he had ſome while rayled out of his diſpleaſure, tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ouer-much griefe, hee cryed out aloude: O Loue! is it poſſible thou ſhouldſt ſuffer ſo great an iniuſtice without puniſhing it? Is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that in thy kingdome, wrongs and ſeruices are equally recompen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? And then holding his peace for a while, at laſt, his eyes lifted vp to heauen, and his armes acroſſe, letting himſelfe goe backeward, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne agayne thus: For concluſion, it pleaſeth thee, Loue, that I muſt giue witneſſe, that there is no conſtancy in any woman; and that <hi>Phillis,</hi> for being of that Sex (though furniſhed with all other perfections) is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the ſame lawes of naturall inconſtancy: I ſay, that <hi>Phillis,</hi> whoſe loue heretofore hath beene more aſſured to me than mine owne will. But why, O my ſhepheardeſſe! am not I the ſam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Licidas,</hi> whoſe affection thou haſt made ſhew to nouriſh ſo much? That which you haue at other times iudged commendable in me, is it ſo much changed that you take more delight in an vnknowne <hi>Siluander,</hi> a vagabond, a man, whom the whole earth contemues, and will not profeſſe him for hers? <hi>Laonice,</hi> who heard this ſhepheard, and <hi>Phillis</hi> and <hi>Siluander</hi> named, deſirous to know more, beganne to giue her eare in good earneſt, and ſo fitly for her, that ſhe learned before ſhe went from thence, all that ſhe could deſire of the moſt ſecret thoughts of <hi>Phillis;</hi> and thereon taking occaſion to anger her or <hi>Siluander,</hi> reſolued to ſet this ſhepheard yet furder into this opinion, aſſuring her ſelfe, that if ſhe loued <hi>Licidas,</hi> ſhe would make him iealous; and if it were <hi>Siluander,</hi> ſhee would publiſh the loue, ſo that euery one might know it.</p>
                  <p>And as ſoone as this ſhepheard was gone, (for his euill would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to ſtay long in a place) ſhe alſo went from thence; and ſetting for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

after him, came very neere him, talking with <hi>Corilas,</hi> whom he had met in the way, and ſeeming to demaund of them newes of the deſolate ſhepheard, they anſwered, they knew none ſuch. It is a ſhepheard (ſayd ſhe to them) that goes lamenting a dead ſhepheardeſſe, and who (as they tell me) is almoſt, euer ſince dinner, in the company of the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Phillis,</hi> and of her ſeruant. And, who is that (anſwerd preſently <hi>Licidas?)</hi> I know not (continued the ſhepheardeſſe:) If I knew to tell his name right, I thinke hee is called <hi>Silander,</hi> or <hi>Siluander,</hi> a ſhepheard of a reaſonable hanſomneſſe of viſage, ſomewhat long, and of an humour pleaſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, when he liſt. Who told you (anſwered <hi>Licidas)</hi> that hee was her ſeruant? The actions of them both (anſwered ſhe:) for I haue paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſuch ſtraits; and I rememberyet vpon what feet they go. But tel me if you know any news of him I ſeek; for night drawes on, and I know not where to finde him. <hi>Licidas</hi> could not anſwer her, he was ſo ſurprized: but <hi>Corilas</hi> told her, that ſhe muſt follow that path, and as ſoone as ſhee was out of this wood, ſhe ſhould ſee a great paſture, where doubtleſſe ſhe might learne ſome newes; for it was there that euery night they met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, before they drew homeward; and that for feare leſt ſhe might wander, he would beare her company, if ſhe pleaſed. She that was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to diſſemble yet more (fayning not to know the way) receiued with great courteſie the offer he made her, and giuing the good night to <hi>Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> tooke the way which was ſhewed her, leauing him ſo quite beſides himſelfe, that he ſtood a great while vnmoueable in one place; at laſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning as out of a long ſwound, he went repeating the words of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe, whereto it was impoſſible but he ſhould giue credit, not able to ſuſpect her of falſhood. It would be too long to repeate heere the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row he made, and the wrongs he did to his faithfull <hi>Phillis.</hi> So it was, that all the night he did nothing but goe compaſſe in the moſt retired part of the wood; where toward morning (wearied with ſorrow and long trauaile) he was conſtrained to lie downe vnder ſome trees, where all wet with teares, at the laſt, his extreme griefe enforced him to ſleepe.</p>

                  <hi>Phillis,</hi> that was of a pleaſant diſpoſition, and would well diſcharge her ſelfe of the experiment whereto ſhe had beene enioyned, turning to <hi>Diane,</hi> Miſtriſſe, ſaid ſhe, will you hereafter giue any credit to the words of this ſhepheard? Yeſterday he loued you not at all: now hee is dead, at leaſt, for loue. Since he would ſay ſo much, he ought to begin in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter houre to ſerue you, or pauſe ſomewhile before he proffer ſuch words. <hi>Siluander</hi> was ſo neere, that he might heare <hi>Phillis,</hi> that made him cry out a farre off, O miſtriſſe, ſhut your eares againſt the euill words of mine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy. And then being come at them, Ah, naughty <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſaid he, is it ſo, that by the ruine of my contentment, you ſeeke to build your owne?

She had gone on, but that the ſhepheard, after he had ſaluted the Nymph, and the ſhepheardeſſes, interrupted her
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:177519:120"/>
thus: You would haue my miſtriſſe miſlike that I ſhould ſpeake of the contentment which I haue in her ſeruice: and why will you not haue me ſay ſo, if it be true? Is it true (anſwered <hi>Phillis?)</hi> ſee what vanity this is! will you ſay yet that ſhe loues you, and that ſhe cannot liue without you? I may not ſay (replyed the ſhepheard) that it is ſo: but I may well ſay, I wiſh it were ſo: but you ſeeme to thinke it ſo ſtrange, that I ſay I haue contentment in the ſeruice which I tender my miſtris, that I am co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled to aske you if you haue not? At leaſt (ſaid ſhe) if I haue, I doe not brag of it. It is ingratitude (replyed the ſhepheard) to receiue good from any, without thanks: and how is it poſſible we can loue that perſon to whom we are vnthankfull? By that (interrupted <hi>Leonide)</hi> I iudge that <hi>Phillis</hi> loues not <hi>Diane.</hi> There are few that giue not the ſame iudgement (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Siluander)</hi> and I beleeue ſhe thinks ſo her ſelfe. If you haue reaſons good enough, you may perſwade me, replyed <hi>Phillis.</hi> If there want no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but reaſon to proue it (ſaid <hi>Siluander)</hi> I haue no more to doe: for whether I proue a thing or deny it, it cannot make it other then it is; ſo that ſince I want but reaſons to prooue your ſmall loue, what haue I to doe to conuince you? That that is to be done, that you loue not <hi>Diane,</hi> belongs to you to prooue. <hi>Phillis</hi> here ſtaid a little troubled to anſwer: and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ſaid to her, It ſeemes, ſiſter, you approue that which the ſhepheard ſaith. I doe not approue it (anſwered ſhe:) but I am much troubled to diſproue it. If it be (added <hi>Diane)</hi> you loue me not at all: for ſince <hi>Siluander</hi> hath found the reaſons which you demand, and againſt which you cannot reſiſt, you muſt confeſſe, that that which he ſaith, is true.</p>
               <p>At this word the ſhepheard came to <hi>Diane,</hi> and ſaid, Faire, and iuſt miſtriſſe, is it poſſible that this enemy ſhepheardeſſe hath yet the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, not to ſuffer me to ſay, that the ſeruice which I yeeld to you, brings me contentment, when this cannot be for the anſwer which you make ſo much to mine aduantage? In ſaying (anſwered <hi>Aſtrea)</hi> that <hi>Phillis</hi> loues her not, ſhe doth not ſay therefore, you do loue her, or that ſhe loues you. If I could heare theſe words, anſwered he, I loue you, or you loue me, out of my miſtriſſes mouth, it ſhould not be a contentment, but a tranſport, that rauiſheth me from my ſelfe, for ouer-great ſatisfaction: and yet if hee that holds his peace, ſeeme to conſent to that he heares, why may not I ſay, my faire miſtriſſe confeſſes that I loue her, ſince, without contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhe heares what I ſay? If Loue (replyed <hi>Phillis)</hi> conſiſt in words, you would haue more then all other men together; for I doe not thinke they will euer faile you, as bad a cauſe as you haue.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonide</hi> tooke wonderfull pleaſure at the diſcourſe of theſe ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes;
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:177519:120"/>
and, had it not beene for the payne wherein ſhe was for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of <hi>Celadon,</hi> ſhe would haue tarried many dayes with them: for albeit ſhe knew he was out of his feuer, yet ſhe could not but feare his relapſe. That was the cauſe ſhe deſired them to take with her the way of <hi>Laigneu</hi> to the riuer, for that ſhe might the longer enioy their company. They a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed willingly; for beſides courteſie ſo commaunded them, they were exceedingly pleaſed with her company. So then, taking <hi>Diane</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Aſtrea</hi> on the other, ſhee went toward the Buttreſſe. But <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uander</hi> was deceiued, who (by chance) was gone furder from <hi>Diane</hi> than was <hi>Phillis,</hi> ſo that ſhe tooke that place that he deſired. Whereat <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> being very glorious, went mocking the ſhepheard, ſaying; that his Miſtris might eaſily iudge, that hee was too ſlouthfull to ſerue her. Shee may grant ſo much (anſwered he) to your importunity, but not to your affection. For, if you loued her, you would not haue left mee the place you had. That ſhould rather be a ſigne of the contrary (ſayd <hi>Phillis)</hi> if I ſuffer another to come neerer than my ſelfe: for if the party that loues, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires almoſt to be transformed into the thing beloued, hee approacheth neereſt, and ſo attaynes the perfection of his deſires. The louer (anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Siluander)</hi> that hath more regard to his owne contentment than of the perſon beloued, deſerues not that title at all. So that you which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard more the pleaſure which you take, in being neere your Miſtris, than you do her commodity, may not ſay you loue her, but your ſelfe onely: For, if I were in the place you are, I would helpe her to goe, and you do but let her. If my Miſtris (replyed <hi>Phillis)</hi> ſhould handle me as you doe, I do not know if I ſhould loue her. I know then aſſuredly (replied the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) that if I were in your Miſtriſſes place, I could not loue you. How now (ſayd he?) haue you the hardineſſe to threaten her thus? Ah <hi>Phillis!</hi> one of the principall lawes of Loue, is, that that party which can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that he may (at ſome times) not loue, is no more a louer. Miſtris, I demaund iuſtice of you, and beſeech you in the behalfe of Loue, that you would puniſh this offence of treaſon, and that thruſting her out of the place, too honorable for her that loues not, you would ſet me in it; me that would not liue, but to loue you.</p>
               <p>Miſtris (interrupted <hi>Phillis)</hi> I ſee well, that this enuious perſon of my good, will not let me be quiet, vnleſſe I quit him this place; and, I feare, with his language, hee will compell you to giue conſent: therefore it is that I deſire to preuent him, if you thinke good, and to leaue it him on this condition, that he declare one thing to you that I ſhall propound. <hi>Siluander</hi> then without ſtaying for <hi>Diane's</hi> anſwer, ſaid to <hi>Phillis:</hi> Only go
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:177519:121"/>
out, (you ſhepheardeſſe) of your owne accord, for I will neuer refuſe this condition, ſince without this adoe I will neuer conceale any thing from her that ſhe deſires to know of me. At this word hee ſet himſelfe in her place: and then <hi>Phillis</hi> ſayd to him. Enuious ſhepheard, though the place where you are, may not be bought, yet haue you promiſed more then you are aware of. For you are bound to tell vs what you are, and what occaſion hath brought you into this Country, ſince you haue beene heere ſo long, and we could neuer yet know but little of it. <hi>Leonide</hi> that was of the ſame minde, taking hold of the words, Queſtionleſſe (ſayd ſhe) <hi>Phillis,</hi> you haue not hitherto ſhewed more wiſedome than in this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. For at one inſtant you haue freed <hi>Diane</hi> and me out of ſome paine; <hi>Diane,</hi> for the diſcommodity you did her, in hindering <hi>Siluander</hi> from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting her as ſhe went; and me, for the deſire I had to know him more particularly. I wiſh earneſtly (anſwered the ſhepheard) fetching a ſigh, I were able to ſatisfie you in this curioſity; but my fortune denies me it (in ſuch manner) that I may truly ſay, I am both more deſirous, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as ignorant as you. For it pleaſed her to cauſe me to be borne, and to make me know that I liue, hiding from me all other knowledge of my ſelfe. And that you may not thinke but that I will performe my promiſe Iſware vnto you by <hi>Theutates,</hi> and by the beauties of <hi>Diane,</hi> ſayd hee, turning to <hi>Phillis,</hi> I will tell you truly all that I know.</p>

                     </hi> to leaue them in peace. Which was not ſo ſoone, but that the Burgoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were gathered together into routes, and that ſo, that their Prouinces, and thoſe that neighboured them, felt the ſmart of it, the enemies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>Now I at that time being about fiue or ſixe yeeres olde, was, with many others, brought by the Burgonians into the vttermoſt towne of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> who to reuenge themſelues, being entred into the Countrey, confederate with their enemies, committed the ſame diſorders they had receiued. To tell you what was the meaning of them that tooke mee, I know not, vnleſſe it were to haue ſome ſumme of money. So it was, that Fortune was ſo good to me, after ſhe had beene my ſecret enemy, that I fel into the hands of an Heluetian, who had a father that was an old man, and a right honeſt, who conceiuing ſome good opinion of me, as well for my countenance, as for ſome pleaſant anſweres, which in that age I had giuen him, tooke me to himſelfe, with a purpoſe to make me a ſtudent; and indeede, though his ſonne contraried him what he could poſſibly, yet for bare he not from following his former deſſigne, and ſo ſpared no coſt to cauſe me to be inſtructed in all kinde of learning, ſending mee to the Vniuerſity of <hi>Marſeilles,</hi> in the prouince of the Romanes. So that I may ſay with good reaſon, that I had beene loſt, if I had not beene loſt. And though (according to my <hi>Genius)</hi> there was nothing more pleaſant to me than letters, yet was it a continuall puniſhment to mee, to thinke, that I knew not from whence, nor who I was, imagining, that this misfortune neuer befell any other. And being in this care, one of my friends aduiſed me, to enquire of ſome Oracle, to know the trueth. For for my part, I was ſo young, that I had no more remembrance than I haue now, either of the place whence I was taken, or where I was borne; and hee that gaue me this counſell, ſayd, that there was no likelihoode, but that the heauens, hauing had ſuch a care of mee, as I haue found ſince I was loſt, they would yet ſhew mee more fauour. This friend knew ſo well how to perſwade me, that wee went both together, and the anſwer we had was this:</p>

much quiet of ſpirit, referring my ſelfe to the guiding of heauen; and employing my ſelfe onely to my ſtudies, wherein I made ſo good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, that the old <hi>Abariel</hi> (for that was the name of him who brought me vp) had a minde to ſee me before he dyed, preſaging his end almoſt at hand. Being then come to him, and hauing receiued the moſt ſweet v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that I could deſire: one day, when I was alone with him in his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he ſpake to me in this ſort, My ſonne, (for as ſuch I haue alwayes loued you, ſince the rigour of warre caſt you into my hands) I doe not thinke you ſo miſ-vnderſtanding what I haue done for you, that you may make queſtion of my good will; yet, if the care I haue had to inſtruct your youth, haue not giuen you ſufficient knowledge of it, I would you ſhould take notice of it, becauſe I deſire to do for you. You know that my ſonne <hi>Azahyde,</hi> who tooke you, and brought you to mee, hath a daughter, whom I loue as my ſelfe: and becauſe I determine to paſſe the few dayes behinde, in quietneſſe and tranquillity, I haue a purpoſe tomarry you to her, and to giue you ſo good a part of my wealth, that I may liue with you, ſo long as it pleaſeth God. And thinke not, that I haue had this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on a ſudden, for it is long ſince I prepared for euery thing. In the firſt place, I was deſirous to know what your humor was, euen when you were a childe, to iudge if you could frame your ſelfe to be with me, for that in ſuch an age there could be but little art, and ſo might we ſee (as naked) all the affections of a ſoule; and finding you ſuch as I wiſhed <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zahyde</hi> to be, I thought good to ſettle the repoſe of my laſt dayes vpon you, and for that cauſe I put you to ſtudy, knowing well, that there is nothing makes a ſoule more capable of reaſon, than the knowledge of things. And during your long abſence from me, I haue determined to marry my young daughter to you, who (to pleaſe me) deſires it almoſt as much as my ſelfe. It is true, ſhe would gladly know, who, and of what place you are.</p>
                  <p>And to ſatiſfie her, I haue enquired of <hi>Azahyde</hi> many times, in what place he tooke you; but he hath alwayes told me, that he knew nothing but that it was at the riuer of <hi>Roſne,</hi> of the prouince of <hi>Viennois,</hi> and that you were giuen by one that brought you two dayes iourney, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſome armors. But it may be, you can remember better, for you might be about fiue or ſixe yeeres of age; and when I asked him whether the cloaths which you then wore, might not giue ſome coniecture of what parents you were deſcended, he anſwered no, for that you were then ſo young, that hardly could one iudge by your habit, of what condition you were. So that, my ſonne, if your memory doe not helpe you herein,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:177519:122"/>
there is no body can free vs of this paine. So the good old <hi>Abariel</hi> held his peace, and taking me by the hand, beſought me to tell him all that I knew. Whereto, after all the thankes I could giue him, as well for the good opinion he had of me, as for the nourture hee had giuen me, and for the marriage which hee propounded, I made him anſwere, that in truth I was ſo yong when I was taken, that I had no remembrance neither of my parents, nor of my condition. This is (replyed the good old man) ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what comberſome, yet we will not let to proceed further, prouided you like of it, not greatly caring to ſpeake with <hi>Azahyde,</hi> but to know your good will. And when I had anſwered him, that I were very ingratefull, if I did not wholy obey his commandement, at that inſtant cauſing mee to go aſide, he ſent to ſeeke out his ſonne, and to tell him his purpoſe, which before my returne hee knew of by his daughter; and the feare of loſing the goods which <hi>Abariel</hi> would giue vs, made him ſo much to diſlike it, that when his father ſpake to him of it, hee ſo long reiected it, and with ſuch reaſons, that in the end the good old man not being able to get his conſent, told him frankely, <hi>Azahide,</hi> if you will not giue your daughter to whom I will, I wil giue my goods to whom you would not; and therefore reſolue to agree to <hi>Siluander,</hi> or I will chuſe him to be mine heire. <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyde,</hi> who was very couetous, and fearing to loſe that good, ſeeing his father in theſe termes, came better to himſelfe, and beſought him to giue him ſome few dayes ſpace to think of it; whereas his father being a good old man, eaſily condeſcended, deſiring to do all things with gentleneſſe, and after told me of it: yet he needed not haue done it, for I perceiued ſo much by the eyes and ſpeech of his ſonne, who began to deale ſo roughly with me, that I could hardly endure it. Now during the time that he had taken, he commanded his daughter, who had a better minde then hee, on paine of death (for he was a man of blood and murther) to make ſhew to the old man, that ſhe was ſorry her father would not ſatiſfie his will, and that ſhe could not helpe it, but with her diſobedience, that ſhe was ready to marry me ſecretly, and when it was done, time might worke her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers content; and this he had in purpoſe to procure my death. The poore wench was much enta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gled: for on the one ſide the ordinary threatnings of her father, whoſe miſchieuous nature ſhe knew too well, egged her on to play this part; on the other ſide, the loue which from her childhood ſhee bare me, with held her. So it was, that her tender yeeres (for ſhee had not paſſed aboue halfe an age) would not let her haue reſolution enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie; and ſo, al trembling, ſhe came to vſe that ſpeech to the good man, who receiued it with that confidence, that after hee had kiſſed her fore-head
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:177519:123"/>
twice or thrice, at laſt he reſolued to put it in practice as ſhe had ſayd, and enioyned me ſo peremptorily, that notwithſtanding all the doubts I had in it, I durſt not contradict it.</p>
                  <p>Now the reſolution was taken in ſuch ſort, that I was to climbe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row a window into the chamber, where I muſt marry her ſecretly. This Towne is ſeated on the vtmoſt bounds of the <hi>Allobroges,</hi> on the ſide of the <hi>Heluecians,</hi> and it is on the banks of the great lake <hi>Leman,</hi> in ſuch ſort, that the waues beat vpon the houſes, and then diſgorge themſelues into <hi>Roſne,</hi> which paſſeth thorow the middeſt of it. The meaning of <hi>Azaby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> was, becauſe their lodgings were that way, to draw mee vp with a cord, halfe the height of the wall, and then to let me fall into the lake, where being drowned, they might neuer heare more newes of mee; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>Roſne</hi> with his ſwiftneſſe, would haue carried me farre off, or touching on the hard rocks, I might haue beene ſo bruiſed, that no man could haue knowne me. And, without doubt, his deſigne had taken ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for I was reſolued to obey the good <hi>Abariel,</hi> had it not beene, that the day before this was to be done, the poore wench, that was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſhew me good countenance, that I might be the more abuſed, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with compaſſion, and out of horrour to bee the cauſe of my death, could not hold from diſcouering it to mee, all trembling, ſaying to mee a little after, You ſee, <hi>Siluander,</hi> in ſauing your life, I procure mine owne death, for I know well, <hi>Azahyde</hi> will neuer pardon me; but I had rather dye an innocent, then liue guilty of your death. After I had thanked her, I told her ſhe ſhould not feare the fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And then toward night I prouided my ſelfe of all the money I could get, without the knowledge of <hi>Abariel,</hi> and ſet ſo good an order to that I was to doe, that the houre being come when I muſt goe to the place appoynted, after I had taken leaue of the olde man who came with me to the ſhore, I mounted into a little barke which hee had proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and then going ſoftly vnder the window, I made ſhew to tye vp my ſelfe, but it was onely my clothes filled vp with grauell: and ſuddainely withdrawing myſelfe aſide, to ſee what would happen, I heard them fall at once into the lake, where, with the ore, I gently beat the water, that they might thinke, when they heard the noyſe, that it was I that beat ſo: but I was quickly compelled to be gone from thence, becauſe they caſt downe ſo many ſtones, that I could hardly ſaue my ſelfe, and ſoone after I

Now when euery one was gone from the window, I heard a great noyſe about the place where I left <hi>Abariel,</hi> and as I might iudge, me thought I heard his exclamations, which I tooke to be occaſioned by the noyſe that hee had heard in the water, fearing I was drowned: ſo it was, that I reſolu'd neuer to go to him more, not that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So then being come to the chaines which lock the port, I was forced to leaue my boat, to goe ſwimming ouer to the other ſide, whither being come with ſome danger, by reaſon of the darkeneſſe of the night, I went to that place where I had hid my other clothes, and whatſoeuer I had of worth; and taking the way of <hi>Agaune,</hi> I came by the poynt of day to <hi>Euians;</hi> and I aſſure you, I was weary: for hauing gone faſt, I was conſtrained to reſt all that day there, where, by fortune not beeing knowne, I was willing to take counſell, as others did in their moſt vrgent affaires, of the wiſe <hi>Bellinde,</hi> who is miſtriſſe of the Veſtals which are along the lake; and as I learned ſince, is the mother of my faire miſtriſſe: ſo it was, that letting her know all my diſaſters, ſhee conſulted the Oracle, and the next day ſhe told me that the god comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded me not to be diſtempered for ſo great aduerſities, and that it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, if I would be gone, to ſeek our the fountaine of the verity of Loue, becauſe in that water was my onely remedy, and as ſoone as I ſhould be there, I might know both my father and my country. And asking her in what place this fountaine was: ſhe gaue me knowledge, that it was in this countrey of <hi>Forreſts;</hi> and then told me the property and the enchantment, with that courteſie, that I am infinitely yet bound vnto her.

Vnicornes, which he had enchanted, and that the ſorcery might not bee vndone, but with the blood and death of two the moſt faithfull Louers that euer were in this countrey. God knowes whether this news brought not me ſorrow, ſeeing my ſelfe almoſt out of hope of that I deſired: yet conſidering this was the Countrey, which the heauens had deſtined for me to know my parents, I thought fit ſtay here, and (it may be) theſe faithfull in loue may at laſt be found out; but yet it is a merchandize ſo rare, that I dare not haue too great an hope. With this purpoſe I reſolued to clothe my ſelfe in ſhepheards weeds, that I might more freely liue with ſuch good companies which are along the riuer of <hi>Lignon;</hi> and that I might not be idle, I imployed all the remnant of my money which I had, vpon cattell, and a little cabbin, to which I haue ſince retired.</p>

I am much delighted (anſwered <hi>Leonide)</hi> in hearing you tell your fortune; and I muſt tell you, that you ought to hope well of your ſelfe, ſince the gods, by their Oracles, ſhew themſelues to haue ſuch care of you: for my part, I pray them for it with all my heart. And ſo do not I (comes in <hi>Phillis</hi> writhing her ſelfe:) for if he were knowne (it may bee) the worth of his father might make him carry away our miſtriſſe; it being very certaine, that good and alliance may do more in marriages, then their worth or loue. Take heede what you ſay (ſaid <hi>Siluander)</hi> you are ſo farre from wiſhing me ſo much hurt, that I hope by your means, to come to the knowledge I deſire. By my meanes (anſwered ſhe?) how can that be?

Faithfull I am, it is true (anſwered <hi>Phillis)</hi> but valiant I am not; ſo that in well louing my miſtris, I will giue place to none; but for my bloud &amp; life, talke no more of it: for what ſeruice can I doe her when I am dead?

Yet ſo it is (replyed he) that (in my iudgement) I loue better to be with her, when you are neere, than when ſhe ſhall be alone.

(ſaid ſhe;) but for this time I am conſtrayned to make an end of my iuor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Yet am I purpoſed, ſo to order my affayres, that I may liue as well with them, as you: for I doe not thinke there is a more happy life than theirs. With ſuch other like diſcourſe ſhe took her leaue of the faire ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes; and after ſtraite embracements, promiſed to come againe to them very ſoone: and ſo parted, much contented and ſatisfied with them, ſo that ſhee reſolued to change the vanities of the Court, to the ſimplicity of that life: but that which moued her moſt, was, that ſhe had a deſire to free <hi>Celadon</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Galathee,</hi> and thought that he would preſently returne into the Hamlet, where ſhe determined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe vnder the ſhaddow of theſe ſhepheardeſſes.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee what was the voyage of <hi>Leonide,</hi> who ſawe the birth of two great loues, that of <hi>Siluander,</hi> vnder a fayned wager, as wee haue ſayd, and that of <hi>Paris,</hi> as wee will ſpeake of, to <hi>Diane.</hi> For ſince that day he grew ſo amorous, that to be more familiar with them, he forſooke the life he vſed, and attired himſelfe as a ſhepheard, and would ſo be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among them, that ſo hee might make himſelfe more pleaſing to his Miſtris; who, for her part, honoured him according to his merit, and as his good will obliged her. But for that, in the courſe of our diſcourſe, wee are to ſpeake after of it, we will ſay no more at this time. Then, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Hamlets, as they drew neere the great meddow, where the moſt part of the flockes fed ordinarily, they might ſee come from farre, <hi>Tircis, Hylas</hi> and <hi>Licidas,</hi> whereof the two firſt ſeemed to diſport in good earneſt; for the geſture of his armes, and the reſt of the bodie of <hi>Hylas</hi> ſhewed as much: as for <hi>Licidas,</hi> he was by himſelfe, his hat pull'd downe, and his hands behind him; he went looking on his feet, ſhewing well hee had ſomething in his ſoule that much troubled him: and when they were ſo neere that they might know them, and that <hi>Hylas</hi> perceiued <hi>Phillis</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſhepheardeſſes; and for that ſince the former day hee beganne to loue her, leauing <hi>Tircis,</hi> he came to her, and without ſaluting the reſt of the company, tooke her vnder the arme, and in his accuſtomed humor (without other ſhew of words) told her the deſire hee had to ſerue her. <hi>Phillis,</hi> who beganne to know him, and was contented to paſſe the time, ſaid; I know not <hi>(Hylas)</hi> whence this wil ſprings, for there is nothing in me that may moue it. If you thinke that you ſay (ſayd he) you owe mee the greater obligation; and if you doe not thinke it, you may iudge me a man of ſpirit, that can know what is worthy to be ſerued, and ſo you may eſteeme of me the better. Doubt not (ſayd ſhe) howſoeuert it be, that I eſteeme you, and that I receiue your loue as it merits; and were it not

for any other conſideration; yet at leaſt, for that you are the firſt that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me. By fortune, while they were talking, <hi>Licidas</hi> comes in, whoſe iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie was ſo high growne, that it ouer-topped his affection; and for his greater hurt, he came in euill time, ſo that he might heare the anſwer that <hi>Hylas</hi> made to <hi>Phillis,</hi> which was thus: I know not (faire ſhepheardeſſe) if you will continue as you beginne with me: but if you doe, you ſhall be the truer; for I know well, that <hi>Siluander,</hi> at leaſt, will help to giue you the lie: and if hee will not doe it for feare of diſpleaſing you, I aſſure my ſelfe, that all that were here yeſterday, wil witneſſe <hi>Siluander</hi> was your ſeruant. I know not whether he hath left his loue vnder his pillow. <hi>Siluander,</hi> that thought not of the loue of <hi>Licidas,</hi> thinking it would be a ſhame for him to diſprooue <hi>Hylas:</hi> and beſides that, that hee ſhould offend <hi>Phillis,</hi> to ſay otherwiſe before her, anſwered; Shepheard, you muſt ſeeke no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther witneſſe than me in this matter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

But as a nayle, the groſſer it is, and the more weight it holdes, the harder it is to be wreſted out: ſo, the tougher and groſſer our affections are in vs, the longer they laſt in our ſoules: ſo that if you haue ſeene mee ſeruitour to this fayre ſhepheardeſſe, you may ſee mee ſo ſtill, for we change not euery time we ſleepe. But if this befall you, I ſay, you that haue an hote brayne, as well as a balde head, and a red hayre, bewrayes much, you are not to giue the ſame cenſure of vs. <hi>Hylas</hi> hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as his ſhepheard ſpeake ſo frankly and ſo truly to his humor, thought that either <hi>Tyrcis</hi> had told him ſomewhat, or that he muſt know it elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: and therefore all aſtonied; Shepheard (ſayd he) haue you ſeene me at any time? or where learned you this you ſpeake of me? I neuer ſaw you (ſayd <hi>Siluander)</hi> but your phiſiognomy and your diſcourſe made me iudge that I ſay. For hardly may a man ſuſpect in another that fault, whereof he is wholly exempted. Of neceſſity then (anſwered <hi>Hylas)</hi> you cannot be exempted from that inconſtancy which you ſuſpect in me. The ſuſpition (replyed <hi>Siluander)</hi> growes, either out of ſome ſmall likelihood, or of the appearance of that which is not, but onely in imagination, and that a man cannot haue of another, without himſelfe be ſpotted. But that which I ſayd of you, is not of ſuſpition, but of a certainty.</p>
                  <p>Call you that ſuſpition, when we heare you ſay, that you haue loued <hi>Laonice,</hi> and leauing her for this ſecond, who was heere yeſterday with her, now you haue left them both for <hi>Phillis,</hi> whom without doubt you will leaue for the firſt commer, whoſe eies will vouchſafe to look on you?

                     <hi>Tircis,</hi> who heard them thus diſcourſe, ſeeing <hi>Hylas</hi> ſtand as ouercome, beganne to ſpeake in this ſort r <hi>Hylas,</hi> you muſt no longer hide your ſelfe, you are diſcouered. This ſhepheard hath cleere eyes to ſee the ſpots of your inconſtancy, you muſt confeſſe the truth. For if you fight againſt it: beſides that, at the laſt, you ſhal be counted a liar, you being not able to reſiſt, for that nothing is ſo ſtrong as Truth, you ſhall be faine to ſhew your weakeneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Confeſſe it then freely to be as it is, and to encourage you, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne. Know (gentle ſhepheard) that it is true, that <hi>Hylas</hi> is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant, the moſt diſloyall, and the greateſt traitour to ſhepheardeſſes, (to whom he promiſes goodwill) that euer was. And ſo (added <hi>Phillis)</hi> that he will oblige them whom he loues not at all. And Me? miſtris, (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Hylas)</hi> are you alſo againſt me? will you beleeue the impoſtures of theſe malicious? Doe you not ſee that <hi>Tircis,</hi> finding himſelfe bound to <hi>Siluander</hi> for the iudgement he gaue in fauour of him, thinks fit to pay him in ſome ſort, by giuing you an euill opinion of me? What doth this import, ſayd <hi>Phillis</hi> to <hi>Siluander?</hi> What doth this import, ſaid the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant? know you not it is harder to take a place poſſeſſed, then that which no man holds? He would ſay (added <hi>Siluander)</hi> The more you loue him, the harder it will be for me to acquire your good graces. But, my friend <hi>Hylas,</hi> how much are you deceiued? ſo farre, that when I ſee ſhe daines to caſt her eye on you, I ſhall be aſſured of her loue. For I know her to be of ſo good iudgement, that ſhee hath alwayes knowledge to chooſe the better. Then anſwered <hi>Hylas,</hi> It may be (glorious ſhepheard) you thinke to haue ſome aduantage ouer me. Miſtris, beleeue him not, for he is of no worth, and indeed, what man can he be that neuer had the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe to loue, nor to ſerue, but one onely ſhepheardeſſe, and that ſo coldly, that you would thinke he ieſted? Whereas I loue as many as I ſee fayre, and of them all I haue beene as well entertayned as I would wiſh. What ſeruice can you hope for of him that is ſuch a nouice, that he kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth not how to beginne? But I that haue ſerued of all ſorts, of all ages, and of all humours, know of what faſhion, and what ought, and what ought not to pleaſe her: and for proofe of what I ſay, ſuffer me to que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion him, if you would know his ignorance. And then turning toward him, he went on, What is it <hi>(Siluander)</hi> that ought moſt to binde a fayre ſhepheardeſſe to loue vs? That is (ſaid <hi>Siluander)</hi> to loue none but her. And what is that (continued <hi>Hylas)</hi> that may pleaſe her moſt? That is (anſwered <hi>Siluander)</hi> to loue her extremely. Now ſee then (ſayes the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant) how ignorantly amorous is this man: ſo farre is that which he
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:177519:126"/>
ſayes from truth, that it ingenders contempt and hatred. For, to loue but her alone, giues her cauſe to thinke, that it is want of courage, that hee dares not vndertake: and ſo thinking herſelfe to be beloued for want of another, ſhe will deſpiſe ſuch a louer: Whereas if you loue in common, for the ſmall worth of the thing, ſhee will not thinke when you come to her, that it is not for that you know not whither elſe to goe; and this will binde her more to loue you, eſpecially, if you come to particulars, and make it appeare to her, that you rely more vpon her: and to perſwade her the better, you tell her all that you know of others, and once in the week, you bring to her all that you haue ſayd, and what they haue anſwered, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the encounter as occaſion requireth, to the end you may make her the more pleaſing: &amp; draw her to cheriſh your company. This way (yong louer) this way ſhall you binde her to any loue. But to pleaſe her you muſt on the contrary, flie, as from poyſon, the extremity of loue, becauſe there is nothing more grieuous betweene two louers, than this ſo great affection: for you that loue in this ſort, to pleaſe your ſelfe, labour to be alwayes neere her, to be alwayes talking with her: ſhe cannot cough, but you muſt aske her, what ſhe ayles; ſhe cannot turne her foot, but you muſt doe the like. To be ſhort, ſhe is almoſt conſtrayned to carry you, you preſſe her, and importune her ſo. But the miſchiefe is, if ſhe be ſicke ſometimes, and that ſhe ſmile not on you, if ſhe ſpeake not to you, and intertaine you not as ſhe was wont, then you fall to whining, &amp; to teares; but ſuch plaints (I ſay) as wherewith you ſo fill her eares, that to free her ſelfe of theſe importunities, ſhe is forced to reſtraine her ſelfe; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when ſhe would be alone, and locke vp her ſelfe for a time to her owne thoughts, ſhe muſt be compelled to come ſee you, to entertayne you, and tell you a thouſand tales to content you.</p>
                  <p>Thinke you this to be a good meane, to haue her loue you? You muſt doe in loue, as in other things, the mediocrity is onely commendable, ſo that you loue after an indifferent faſhion, to auoyde all thoſe troubleſome importunities: neither yet is this ſufficient for to pleaſe her: it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough not to diſpleaſe, but you muſt haue ſome allurements which may be louely; and that is, to be pleaſant, cheerefull, to be alwaies ready to tell a merry tale; and aboue all, to be neuer ſilent before her. Thus, <hi>Siluander,</hi> muſt be binde a ſhepheardeſſe to loue vs, and ſo gaine her good Graces. Now ſee, miſtriſſe, if I may not go for a maſter, and what reckoning you are to make of my affection. She would haue anſwered, but <hi>Siluander</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her, beſeeching her to ſuffer him to ſpeake. And then he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Hylas</hi> in this ſort: What is it (ſhepheard) that you moſt deſire,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:177519:127"/>
when you loue? To be beloued (anſwered <hi>Hylas.)</hi> But (replyed <hi>Siluan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)</hi> when you are beloued, what do you wiſh for moſt in this loue? That the perſon whom I loue (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> make more of me then of any other; that ſhe truſt me, and endeuor to pleaſe me. Is it poſſible then (inferrs <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uander)</hi> that to preſerue life, you take poyſon? how will you haue her truſt you, when you will not be faithfull? But (ſaid the ſhepheard) ſhee ſhall not know that. And ſee you not (anſwered <hi>Siluander)</hi> that you will do that with treaſon, which you ſhould doe with ſincerity? If ſhe know not that you loue another, ſhe will thinke you faithfull, and ſo this diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling may profit you; but iudge if diſſembling may doe you as much good as truth.</p>
                  <p>You talke of contempt and deſpite; and there is nothing that ſoone<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>r brings them both in a generous ſpirit, than to think that he, whom now I ſee before mee on his knees, is weary with doing ſo before a ſcore that may not compare with me: that mouth, with which he kiſſes my hand, is dried vp with the kiſſes it giues to the firſt hand it meets; and thoſe eyes, with which he ſeemes to commit idolatry to my face, are yet ſparkling with the loue of all thoſe that haue the name of woman: and what haue I to doe with a thing ſo common? And why ſhould I make much of him, when he will doe nothing more for mee, then for the firſt that vouchſafes to looke on him? When he talkes to me, he thinks it is to ſuch or ſuch an one; and the words that he vſes, hee learned at the ſchoole of ſuch an one, or, he comes to ſtudie heere, that he may goe vtter it there. God knows how ſoone contempt and deſpite may make her conceiue this thought: and ſo for the ſecond poynt, that to make himſelfe beloued, hee muſt loue but a little; he muſt be merry and pleaſant. For, to be iocund and alwayes laughing, is fit for a Ieſter, and one of ſuch a mould. But for a louer, that is, for another our ſelfe, O <hi>Hylas,</hi> hee muſt haue other condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. You ſay, that in all things mediocrity onely is good. That is it (ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) that hath no part of the extreme of the meane or defect, as fayth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. For, he that is but a little faithfull, is not faithfull at all; and he that is, is in the extreme, that is to ſay, there can be none greater than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in faythfulneſſe; ſo it is of valiancy, and ſo it is of loue: for hee that can meaſure it, or that can imagine any other greater than his owne, loues not: So you ſee, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that when you commaund to loue in a meane, you ſet downe a thing impoſſible; and when you doe ſo, you doe like vnto the melancholique fooles, that thinke they know all Sciences, and yet know nothing, when you haue an opinion you loue, but indeed you loue not.</p>

                     <pb n="261" facs="tcp:177519:127"/>
But be it ſo, that one may loue a little: and know you not, that Loue hath no other harueſt but loue, and all that it ſoweth, is but only to reape that fruit? And how would you haue her whom you loue but a little, loue you a great deale, ſince it muſt fall out, that what ſhee gayneth, ſhe ſhall loſe a part of that which ſhee ſoweth in ſo ingratefull ground? Shee ſhall neuer know (ſayes <hi>Hylas)</hi> that I loue ſo. See (ſayd <hi>Siluander)</hi> the ſame treaſon which I reproached you with before. And imagine you, whereas you ſay, the effects of an extreme loue, are the importunities which you haue reckoned, that if you render them not, ſhee will not eaſily coniecture the feebleneſſe of your loue. O <hi>Hylas,</hi> how little you know in loue!</p>
                  <p>Theſe effects which the extremity of Loue brings forth, and which you call importunities, are ſuch (it may be) to thoſe that, like you, know not to loue, and neuer approached neere vnto that god. Who hath loſt his ſight, but they that are thorowly touched, they which do loue in earneſt, and know what are the dueties, and what the ſacrifices which they offer at the Altars of Loue? So farre are they from giuing to ſuch effects the name of importunities, that they call them felicities and perfect contentments. Know you well, that to loue, is to die in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to reuiue in another, that it is not to loue himſelfe, but ſo much as he is pleaſing to the beloued; and ſhortly, it is to transforme himſelfe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely (if it may be) into her. And can you imagine, that one that loues in this ſort, can be combred with the preſence of him whom ſhe loues, and that the knowledge which ſhe hath to be truely loued, is not a thing ſo delightfull, that all others in reſpect of it, cannot ſo much as be taſted?</p>
                  <p>And if you had at any time prooued, that it is thus to loue, as I ſay, you would neuer thinke that hee which thus loues, could do nothing but diſpleaſe, when that ſhould not be but onely for this, that whatſoeuer is marked with this character of Loue, cannot be diſpleaſing; and your ſelfe will confeſſe, that it is ſo deſirous to pleaſe, that if it commit a fault, euen that error pleaſes, ſeeing with what intent it is done; whereas the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be pleaſing, giues ſuch force to a true loue, that though he render himſelfe not ſo to all the world, yet is he neuer fayling to her whom hee loueth.</p>
                  <p>Thence it comes, that many which are not iudged in generall more louely then others, yet are beloued and eſteemed by ſome one. Now you ſee, <hi>Hylas,</hi> if you be not very ignorant, that till now you beleeued you loued, and yet you did but abuſe the name of Loue, &amp; abuſe them whom you thought you loued. How (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> did I neuer yet loue? What
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:177519:128"/>
haue I then done with <hi>Carlis, Amarauthe, Laonice,</hi> and ſo many others? Know you not (ſaid <hi>Silander)</hi> that in all ſorts of Artes, there bee ſome that doe right, and others wrong? Loue is of that kinde: for one may loue rightly, as my ſelfe, and wrongfully, as you; and ſo one may call me a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and you a marrer of Loue. At theſe laſt words there were none could hold from laughter, but <hi>Licidas,</hi> who hearing this diſcourſe, could not but more ſtrengthen himſelfe thereby in his iealouſie, which <hi>Phillis</hi> greatly regarded not, thinking ſhe had giuen proofs great enough of her loue; ſo that in reaſon, he was not to doubt it; but ignorance knowes not that iealouſie in Loue is Iuie, that drawes to it ſelfe the nouriſhment which ſhould goe to the good branches, and good fruit; and the greater it is, the more it ſhewes the fertility of the place, and the ſtrength of the plant. <hi>Paris,</hi> that admired the great ſpirit of <hi>Siluander,</hi> knew not what to iudge of him, and thought, that if he had beene bred among ciuill folke, he had beene without paralell, ſince liuing among ſhepheards, hee was ſuch, that he knew none more gentle. That was the cauſe that he reſolued to make friendſhip with him, more freely to enioy his company. And to procure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hold on their diſputation, he turned to <hi>Hylas,</hi> &amp; ſaid, that he muſt confeſſe he had taken the worſe part, ſince he ſtood ſo long mute. He neede not be aſtonied for that (ſaid <hi>Diane)</hi> ſince there is not ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a iudge as the conſcience; <hi>Hylas</hi> knowes well, hee argues againſt the truth, and it is onely to flatter his fault. And though <hi>Diane</hi> held on this diſcourſe ſome while, yet <hi>Hylas</hi> anſwered not a word, being buſie in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding <hi>Phillis,</hi> who when ſhe was neere <hi>Licidas,</hi> entertained him courſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enough: and becauſe <hi>Aſtrea</hi> would not haue him ouer-heare what ſhe ſaid to him, ſhe diuers times interrupted him, vntil at laſt ſhe conſtrained him to ſay, If <hi>Phillis</hi> be ſo importuned, I will not loue at all. Truely ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, ſaid ſhe, (expreſſely to hinder him from harkening) if you bee as vngracious to her, as vnciuill to vs, ſhee will make no great account of you. And for that <hi>Phillis,</hi> without taking heede to this diſpute, held on her diſcourſe, <hi>Diane</hi> ſaid to her, What, <hi>Phillis,</hi> doe you thus ſhew the duty you owe me? Will you leaue mee then to entertaine a ſhepheard? Whereat <hi>Phillis</hi> ſurprized, anſwered, I would not, miſtriſſe, this errour ſhould diſpleaſe you, for I was of opinion, that this goodly diſcourſe of gentle <hi>Hylas,</hi> would haue kept you from heeding mee, who in the meane time was giuing order to an affaire that this ſhepheard ſpoke of to mee; and indeede ſhe lyed not, for ſhe was much buſied for the coldneſſe ſhee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="263" facs="tcp:177519:128"/>
that all theſe defects are but ſmall proofes of your little loue, and that in time and place I ſhall remember in what faſhion you ſerue me. <hi>Hylas</hi> had taken <hi>Phillis</hi> by the waſte, and not knowing the wager of <hi>Siluander</hi> and her, was amazed to heare <hi>Diane</hi> ſpeake ſo: therefore ſeeing her ready to beginne her excuſe, he preuented her, ſaying, Who would ſay, faire miſtriſſe, that this glorious ſhepheardeſſe would handle you thus courſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? will you yeeld to her in any thing? Commit not this fault, I beſeech you: for though ſhe be faire, yet haue you beauty enough, to make you a part, and which (it may be) giues no place to hers. Ah! <hi>Hylas</hi> (ſaid <hi>Phillis)</hi> if you knew againſt whom you ſpeake, you would rather chooſe to be mute the reſt of your life, then to be prouided of a word that might diſpleaſe this faire ſhepheardeſſe, who in the twinkling of an eye, may (if you loue) make you the moſt vnhappy m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And what neede haue I (ſayd <hi>Hilas)</hi> of her pitty?

How (ſayd the ſhepheard?) will you conſtraine me to tell my life before my Miſtris? and what opinion will ſhee haue of me, when ſhee ſhall heare ſay that I haue loued aboue an hundred? that to ſome I haue bid farewell before I left them, and left others, before I ſayd any thing to them? when ſhee ſhall know that at one and the ſame time I was diuided among many, what will ſhe thinke of me?

                  <p>Among the principal Countries, that the <hi>Roſne</hi> in his ſwift courſe viſits, after it hath receiued <hi>Arar, Iſere, Durance,</hi> &amp; other riuers, he comes daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon the ancient walls of the towne of <hi>Arles,</hi> chiefe of that country, and the moſt peopled and richeſt of the Romane prouince. Neere this faire towne, there incamped a great while ſince, as I heard our Druides tell, a great Captaine, named <hi>Cains Marins,</hi> before the notable victory which he got againſt the <hi>Cimbres, Cimmerieux,</hi> and <hi>Celtoſeites,</hi> at the foote of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> who being deuided by the deepe <hi>Scitique Ocean,</hi> with their wiues and children, purpoſing to ſacke <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſo ouerthrowne by this great captaine, that there remained not one aliue: and if the Romane armes had ſpared any one, the barbarous fury that was in their cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, made them turne their owne hands againſt themſelues, and in rage kill themſelues, that they might not liue being vanquiſhed. Now the Romane army, to aſſure their allies and friends of their common wealth, comming to encampe, as I told you, neere that towne, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of that wary nation, compaſſing their campe with trenches, it fel out that being nere to <hi>Roſne</hi> this riuer which is moſt viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, and which threatens and beates inceſſantly his bankes, by little and little in time met with theſe large &amp; deepe ditches, and with maine ſtrength en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the chanell which he found already made; runs with ſuch fury, that makes the ditches ſtretch out to the ſea, where hee goes diſcharging himſelfe by this meanes, two wayes: for the ancient courſe hath alwayes followed his ordinary way, and this new one is growne ſo great, that it equalls the greateſt riuers, making betweene both a moſt delectable and forcible Iland, and becauſe they were the trenches of <hi>Cains Marins,</hi> the people by corruption of the word, call it <hi>Carmage,</hi> of his name: and ſince,

for that the place is inuironed with theſe two armes of <hi>Roſne,</hi> and the midland ſea they call it the Iſle of <hi>Camarge.</hi> I would not haue ſayd ſo much about the originall of this place, had it not bene that it was the countrey of my natiuity, and where they, of whom I am deſcended, haue long time dwelt: for by reaſon of the fertility of the place, and that it is as it were cut out from the reſt of the land, there is a number of ſhepheards that are withdrawne thither, which for the abundance of paſturage, they call Paſture, and my fathers haue alwayes bene held in ſome conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on among the principall, were it for that they were thought good and vertuous men, were it for that they had honeſtly, and after their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acquired the goods of fortune; ſo they left me ſufficiently prouided: for, when they died, which was (without doubt) too ſoone for me, for my father died the day that I was borne, and my mother bred me vp with all manner of delicateneſſe, an only child, or rather a marred child, endured but till I was twelue yeeres of age.

And that which fortified me in this opinion, was that a faire and wiſe ſhepheardeſſe my neighbour, called <hi>Carlis,</hi> made me all the honeſt ſhowes, which neighbour-hood might challenge. I was ſo yong as yet, that none of the incommodities which loue vſes to bring to the louer, by his violent tranſports, could reach me, that I felt nothing but ſweeteneſſe, and on that ſubiect, I remember, that ſome time I went ſinging theſe verſes.</p>

But that which brought him moſt diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, was, that the parents of this ſhepheardeſſe deſired there might be a marriage betweene her and me, for that they were of opinion, that it would be for her aduantage. Whereof <hi>Hermante</hi> being aduertiſed, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially knowing by the ſpeech of the ſhepheardeſſe, that indeede ſhee loued me, he thought ſhe would withdraw from me, if I began to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from her. Hee well found out (as I told you) that I would change as ſoone as occaſion was offered. And after he had conſidered with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, how he might beginne this deſigne, he thought, that working in mee an opinion of my greater worth, he might ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Hee brought it about very eaſily: for beſides that I beleeued him as my friend, this good could not be very deare vnto me, which befel me without paine, &amp; made me beleeue I might compaſſe any thing of the beſt, if I would beſtow the ſtudy. Hee
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:177519:131"/>
on the other ſide knew ſo well to perſwade me, that I held for certaine, that there was not a ſhepheardeſſe in all <hi>Carmage,</hi> that would not more willingly entertaine me, then I would make choyce of her. Aſſured by this beleefe, I thruſt <hi>Carlis</hi> wholly out of my ſoule, after I had made electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of another, whom I iudged the worthier: and, without doubt, I decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued not my ſelfe, for ſhe had beauty enough to winne loue, and wiſedome to carry it: her name was <hi>Stilliane,</hi> eſteemed among the faireſt and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt of all the Iland, otherwiſe lofty, and ſuch an one, as I muſt haue to put me out of the error wherein I was.</p>
                  <p>And ſee what my preſumption was! Becauſe ſhe was ſerued by many, and they all loſt their time, I beganne to woo her the more willingly, that the world might take better knowledge of my merit. <hi>Carlis,</hi> which truely loued me, was aſtonied at this change, not knowing what cauſe I might haue, but ſhe muſt needes ſuffer it. She did much to recall me, and at the firſt vſed all forts of allurements which ſhe could think of: which I tooke no heede of to returne, I was in the deepe ſeas, there was no meane to come backe to land ſo readily. But if ſhe tooke diſpleaſure at this ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſhe was fully reuenged on him that was the cauſe of the euill: for conceiting to my ſelfe, that as ſoone as I aſſured <hi>Stilliane</hi> of my loue, ſhee would more willingly giue her ſelfe to me; at the firſt time I met her, to talke within an aſſembly which was purpoſely made; dauncing with her, I ſaid, Faire ſhepheardeſſe, I know not what your force is, nor with what charmes your eyes furniſh themſelues; ſo it is, that <hi>Hylas</hi> ſees himſelfe now ſo much become your ſeruant, that no man can bee more. Shee thought I mocked her, knowing well the loue that I had borne to <hi>Carlis,</hi> which made her anſwer ſmilingly, Theſe diſcourſes, are they of thoſe that you learne in the ſchoole of faire <hi>Carlis?</hi> I would haue anſwered, when acording to the order of the dance, there were that ſeparated vs, and I could not come neere her afterward, howſoeuer I laboured it: ſo that I was conſtrained to ſtay vntill the aſſembly brake vp. And ſeeing her goe with the formoſt, to withdraw themſelues, I aduanced my ſelfe, and tooke her by the arme. Shee at the firſt beganne to ſmile, and after ſaid, Is it vpon reſolution, <hi>Hylas,</hi> or commandement, that this night you haue enterprized thus on me? Why (anſwered I) make you this demand? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaid ſhe) I ſee ſo ſmall likelihood of reaſon, in that you do that I can not ſuſpect, but from thoſe two occaſions. It is, ſaid I, for them both; for I am reſolued neuer to loue but the faire <hi>Stilliane,</hi> and your beauty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds me to loue none other. I beleeue (anſwered ſhe) that you thinke not that you ſpeake to me, or that you know me not; and, that you may
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:177519:131"/>
no longer deceiue your ſelfe; know that I am not <hi>Carlis,</hi> and that I call my ſelfe <hi>Stilliane.</hi> I muſt be much deceiued (anſwered I) to take you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Carlis;</hi> for ſhe is too imperfect, to be taken for you, or you for her. And I know too well, for my liberty, that you are <hi>Stilliane,</hi> and it were more for my reſt that I knew leſſe. Wee were come as farre as her lodging, and yet could I not find, whether ſhe liked of it or no. The next morning, it was no ſooner day, but I went to ſeek out <hi>Hermante,</hi> to tell him what befell me. In the euening I found him yet in his bed. And ſeeing me ſomewhat moued: How now, fayd he! what newes? Is the victory ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without combat? Ah my friend (anſwered I) I haue found out one I may talke to; ſhe diſdaines mee, ſhe mockes me, ſhe ſends me at euery word to <hi>Carlis:</hi> to be ſhort, ſhe vſes me like a Miſtris. He could not hold from laughter, when he had heard all the diſcourſe at length, for he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no leſſe. But knowing well my changing humour, hee feared I would goe backe to <hi>Carlis,</hi> and that ſhe would entertaine me, which was the cauſe that he anſwered me: Did you hope for leſſe from he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>? Would you thinke her worthy your loue, if not yet knowing in truth, that you loue her, ſhe ſhould giue her ſelfe to you? How may ſhe giue credite to a few words which you haue vſed, hauing heretofore heard ſo much, or that you ſweare the contrary to <hi>Carlis?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vndoubtedly, it were a very eaſie conqueſt, that ſhe ſhould ſhew her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vanquiſhed for ſo ſmall a fight. But (ſaid I) before I am beloued of her, if it be needfull that I tel her, what I haue done to <hi>Carlis,</hi> when ſhould this be by your aduice? Truely (anſwered <hi>Hermante)</hi> you little know what belongs to Loue: you muſt learne, <hi>Hylas,</hi> that when one ſayes to a ſhepheardeſſe, I loue you, eſpecially when they make ſome demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhe doth not ſo eaſily beleeue it; for that it is the cuſtome of ſhepherds well bred, to haue it of courteſie, and it ſeemeth their Sexe, for the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, binds men to ſerue and honour them. And on the contrary, vpon the leaſt ſhew of miſlike which one giues them, they quickly thinke they are hated; becauſe loues are naturall, but enmities are not ſo: and they that goe againſt nature, it muſt be on a reſolute deſigne: whereas they that follow that way, ſeeme to do by cuſtome. Therefore, <hi>Hylas,</hi> I tel you, that you ſhall more eaſily make <hi>Carlis</hi> beleeue you hate her, vpon the leaſt euill will you ſhew her, then you can perſwade <hi>Stilliane</hi> you loue her. And becauſe you may ſee ſhe hath on her heart that you loue <hi>Carlis,</hi> beleeue me, that that which you haue to doe of moſt neceſſity, is to giue her knowledge that you no more loue this <hi>Carlis:</hi> which you muſt do by ſome action, known not onely to <hi>Carlis,</hi> but to <hi>Stilliane,</hi> and many others.

I muſt not lie: the reading of this letter touched me a little, for I knew well in my conſcience, I had done wrong to this ſhepheardeſſe; but the new affection which <hi>Stilliane</hi> had bred in me, ſuffered me not to ſtay long; and at laſt, howſoeuer it was, I caſt the fault on her. For, ſayd I, in my ſelfe, If ſhe be not ſo fayre nor ſo louely as <hi>Stilliane,</hi> is it I that am guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie? Let her complayne to them which haue made her of leſſe perfection: And for my part, what can I contribute, but to be ſorry, and bewayle with her her pouerty? But this ought not to hinder me from adoring and deſiring the riches of another. With ſuch reaſons I endeuoured to chaſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> me the compaſſion which Loue had made in me. And thinking I had no more to do than to receiue <hi>Stilliane,</hi> who by this time, mee thought, was wholly mine; I deſired <hi>Hermante</hi> to carry to her a letter in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: and withall, I let him ſee the Letter I writ to <hi>Carlis,</hi> that ſhe ſhould no more doubt her.

He would haue gone on, but ſhe all impacient interrupted him: Ceaſe, <hi>Hermante,</hi> you labour in vaine, neither <hi>Hylas</hi> hath worth enough, nor you perſwaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſufficient, to giue me the will to change my contentment for his: Nor wiſh I my ſelfe ſo much euill, nor ſo much good to <hi>Hylas,</hi> that I will conſent to mine owne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſſe, by beleeuing your words. It ſuffices me, <hi>Hermante,</hi> that the humour of <hi>Hylas</hi> is knowne to mee at anothers coſt, without mine owne triall: And it ſhould be enough to you, that <hi>Carlis</hi> is weakely deceiued, though you ſerue not as an inſtrument for the ruine of ſome other. If you loue <hi>Hylas,</hi> I loue <hi>Stillaine</hi> much more; and if you will giue him the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of a friend, counſell him as I counſell her, that is, that ſhee neuer loue <hi>Hylas:</hi> ſay to him likewiſe, that he neuer loue <hi>Stilliane.</hi> And if hee will not beleeue you, aſſure your ſelfe, to his confuſion, hee ſhall employ his time in vayne: and for the letter which you preſent me, I will make no difficulty to take it, hauing ſo good defences againſt his weapons, that I feare not a whit the blowes. At this word vnfolding my letter, ſhe read it aloude, it was at laſt but an aſſurance of my affection by the Conge which I had giuen to <hi>Carlis</hi> for her ſake, and a right humble ſupplication, that

                     <hi>Hermante</hi> had not ſeene this Letter, when he deliuered it me, and yet he had an opinion there was much coldneſſe in it, yet did not hee thinke ſhee ſhould haue made it ſo ſtrange, neyther was he ſo much aſtonied as my ſelfe: for I ſtoode like a man bereaued of his wits, letting the Letter fall on the ground; and after, being come to my ſelfe, I pulled downe my hat ouer mine eares, caſt mine eyes downe on the earth, croſſed mine armes ouer my breſt, and a great pace, without ſpeaking, began to walke about the chamber. <hi>Hermante</hi> ſtood immoueable in the middeſt, not ſo much as caſting his eyes towards me. We ſtayed ſome time in this manner, not ſpeaking; at laſt, in an inſtant ſtriking one hand againſt the other, and making a leape in the middeſt of the chamber: At her peril, ſaid I aloude: let her ſeeke who will loue her, that ſhe may know if there want in <hi>Carmaine</hi> ſhepheardeſſes more faire than ſhe; and who wil be wel pleaſed that <hi>Hylas</hi> would ſerue them? And then turning to him; O what a foole is <hi>Stilliane,</hi> ſaid I, if ſhe thinke I will loue by force? and I ſhall haue but little courage, if I euer trouble my ſelfe for her: and why thinkes ſhee her ſelfe better than another? It is true; ſhe deſerues one ſhould ſuffer ſome paine for her. I aſſure my ſelfe, <hi>Hermante,</hi> ſhe reſolued it while you talked with her; and that could not be, without making at leaſt her eyes narrow,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:177519:133"/>
without biting her lip, and without rubbing one hand on another, to make them white. I ſcoffe at her fancies, and her ſelfe too, if ſhe thinke I take more care for her, than I doe for the greateſt ſtranger in <hi>Gaule.</hi> She knowes not how to reproch me but with my <hi>Carlis.</hi> True it is I loue her, and in deſpite of her, I will loue her ſtill; and I make no queſtion, but ſhe ſhall ſoone enough finde her want of wiſedome, but ſhe muſt neuer hope that <hi>Hylas</hi> can loue her. I ſpake ſuch like words: at which I ſaw <hi>Hermante</hi> change colour; but I was then ignorant of the cauſe: ſince, I haue iudged it was for the feare he had, that I might come againe into the good graces of his Miſtris. Yet made he no other ſhew, but that he ſtrained himſelfe to laugh, and told mee it would make them much amazed, when they ſhould ſee that change, if I tooke that reſolution, as readily would I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute it: and in that diſſeine I went to finde out <hi>Carlis,</hi> of whom I asked a thouſand pardons for the Letter which I had written to her, aſſuring her, that it was not want, but tranſport of affection. She that was angry with me, as one may well thinke, after ſhe had heard me quietly, at laſt, anſwered me thus: <hi>Hylas,</hi> if the aſſurances you make to me of your good will be true, I am ſatisfied; if they be falſe, thinke not that euer you can remoue the amity which for euer you haue broken, for your humour is very dangerous. She would haue ſayd on, when <hi>Stilliane,</hi> to ſhew her the Letter I had written to her, comming to viſit her, interrupted vs, when ſhe ſaw me by <hi>Carlis.</hi> Wake I, or dreame I, (ſayd ſhe) all aſtonied? Is this <hi>Hylas</hi> that I ſee, or is it ſome fancy? <hi>Carlis</hi> wel pleaſed with this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, It is <hi>Hylas</hi> indeede (companion) ſayd ſhe, deceiue not your ſelfe: and if it pleaſe you to come neere, you ſhall heare the ſweete words, with which he cries me mercy; and how he vnſayes all that which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to me, ſubmitting himſelfe to ſuch puniſhment as ſhall pleaſe mee. His chaſticement (anſwered <hi>Stilliane)</hi> ought to be no other than to make him continue the affection he beares me. To you (ſaid <hi>Carlis?)</hi> ſo farre is it, that hee ſware when you entred in, that hee loued none but mee. And ſince when (added <hi>Stilliane?)</hi> I know well, at the leaſt, that I haue a good writing that <hi>Hermante</hi> an howre ſince brought me in his behalfe: and, that you may not doubt of that I ſay; reade this paper, and you ſhall ſee if I lie. O God, what became of me at theſe words? I ſweare vnto you (faire ſhepheardeſſe) that I was not able to open my mouth for my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. And that which ruined me for euer, was, that by miſ-hap many other ſhepheardeſſes came in at the ſame time, to whom they told this tale, ſo much to my diſaduantage, that I could not poſſibly tarry there any longer, but without ſpeaking a word vnto them, I came to tell <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mante</hi>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:177519:134"/>
my miſaduenture, who had like to haue dyed with laughter, as indeed the matter deſerued. This bruite ſo ſpred ouer all <hi>Carmague,</hi> that I durſt not talke to any one ſhepheardeſſe, that caſt it not in my teeth, whereat I conceiued ſuch ſhame, that I reſolued to goe out of the Ile for ſome time. You may ſee, if when I was young, I tooke ſuch thought to be called inconſtant, I ought not at this houre to giue backe a ſtep. See what it is (ſayd <hi>Paris)</hi> one muſt be an apprentice before he be a maſter. It is true (anſwered <hi>Hylas)</hi> and the worſt is, wee muſt often pay for our apprentiſhip. But to come to our diſcourſe, being no longer able to endure the ordinary warre which euery one made on me, the moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly I could poſſibly, I gaue order for my buſineſſe, and referred the whole care to <hi>Hermante;</hi> and after I put my ſelfe into a great veſſell that lanched out with many others. I had then no other purpoſe, but to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell and paſſe away the time, grieuing no more for <hi>Carlis</hi> nor <hi>Stilliane,</hi> than if I had neuer ſeene them: for, I had ſo loſt their remembrance, when I loſt their ſight, that I had not the leaſt ſorrow. But ſee how hard it is to croſſe the naturall diſpoſition! I had no ſooner ſet my foote into the Barke, but I ſawe a new ſubiect of Loue.</p>
                  <p>There was among many other paſſengers, an old woman which went to <hi>Lyons,</hi> to render her vowes in the Temple of <hi>Venus,</hi> which ſhee had made for her ſonne, and carried with her her daughter in law for the ſame cauſe; and who with good cauſe might beare the name of faire, for ſhe was no leſſe then <hi>Stilliane,</hi> and much more then <hi>Carlis:</hi> her name was <hi>Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee,</hi> and could not reach aboue 18. or 20. yeeres, and though ſhee was of <hi>Carmague,</hi> yet ſhee knew me not, becauſe her husband being ielous (as ordinarily old men are, that haue yong and faire wiues) and her mother in law ſuſpitious, held her ſo ſhort, that ſhe neuer came into any aſſembly. At the inſtant that I ſaw her, ſhe pleaſed me, and what purpoſe ſoeuer I had to the contrary, I muſt loue her; but I then foreſaw well, I ſhould find ſome paine, being to deceiue the ſtepmother, and the daughter in law. Yet not to yeeld to the difficulty, I reſolu'd to employ all my wits; and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I was to beginne my enterpriſe by the mother (for ſhee kept me from comming neere my enemy) I thought nothing fitter then to make my ſelfe known to her: and that could not be, for that being of one place, no ancient amity of our family, or ſome former alliance, would make eaſie the meane to grow familiar with her; but the occaſion afterwardes taught mee what I had to do; I was not deceiued in this opinion: for as ſoone as I told her who I was, and that I had fained ſome bad reaſon to cloake that I went about, which ſhe tooke for good, and that I had aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:177519:134"/>
her, that that which made mee diſcouer my ſelfe to her, was but to deſire her freely to make vſe of me. My ſonne (anſwered ſhee) I do not wonder that you ſhould ſhew ſuch good will towards me, for your father loued me ſo well, that you ſhould much degenerate, if you had not ſome ſparkes of that affection. Ah my child, thou art the ſonne of an honeſt, and the moſt louing man that was in all <hi>Carmague:</hi> and ſpeaking theſe words, ſhe tooke me by the head, and holding me to her breſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times kiſſing my forehead; and her kiſſes made me remember the harths that yet retaine a gentle heate after the fire is out: for my father ſhould haue married her, and it may bee, he had done her too much ſeruice for her reputation, as I vnderſtood afterward: but I, that little cared for ſuch kindneſſes, but as they might be profitable for my purpoſe, fayning to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them with much obligation, thanked her for the loue ſhe had borne my father, beſeeching her to turne that good will towards the ſonne; and that ſince the heauens had made mee heire to the reſt of his goods, ſhee would not diſ-inherrit me of that which I eſteemed moſt of, which was, the honor of her good graces; and that for my part, I would ſucceed in the ſeruice which my father had vowed to her, as to the beſt of all his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. To bee ſhort (faire ſhepheardeſſe) I knew how to flatter my old woman; ſo that ſhee loued nothing more then mee: and contrary to her cuſtome, to gratifie me, ſhe commanded her daughter in law to loue me. Oh how well had ſhe bene aduiſed, if ſhe had followed her counſell! but I neuer found any thing ſo cold in all her actions: ſo that though I were with her all the day, yet had I not the hardineſſe to make my purpoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by my words, till we came neere to <hi>Auignion;</hi> for <hi>Stilliane</hi> had made me loſe much of that opinion which I had of my ſelfe. But beſides this, ſhe was alwayes at the feete of the old woman, who intertained me with the times paſſed. It fell out, that this company with which we went, as I haue told you, and many marchants aſſembled together, made a faire, to traffique in the Iland neere <hi>Auignion;</hi> and for as much as we that were not vſed to ſuch voyages, found our ſelues benummed with ſitting ſo long, while the boatemen were about their buſineſſe, wee ſet foote on land to walke about; and among others, the mother of <hi>Aymee</hi> was of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. As ſoone as my ſhepheardeſſe was in the Ile, ſhe began to runne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the riuer, and to play with the other wenches which were come forth of the boate of that company, and I thruſt my ſelfe among them, to haue the meane to take time for my purpoſe, while the old woman was walking with other women of her age. And by hap <hi>Aymee</hi> being ſomewhat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from her companions, gathering floures that grew by the waters
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:177519:135"/>
ſide, I aduanced my ſelfe, and tooke her by the arme: and after wee had gone ſome while without ſpeech, at laſt, as comming from a ſound ſleep, I ſayd vnto her, I ſhould be aſhamed (faire ſhepherdeſſe) to be ſo long mute ſo neere you, hauing ſo good cauſe to ſpeake to you, if I had not more to hold my peace, and if my ſilence did not proceed from thence, whence my words ſhould ariſe. I know not, <hi>Hylas,</hi> ſaid ſhe, what cauſe you haue to hold your peace, nor what you may haue to ſpeake; and leſſe, what words or ſilences you meane. Ah, faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſayd I) the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which conſumes me with a ſecret fire, giues mee ſuch occaſion to ſhew my hurt, that hardly can I hold my peace; and on the other ſide, that affection makes me feare ſo to offend her whom I loue, in declaring it to her, that I dare not ſpeake: ſo that the affection which ought to put words into my mouth, is that which denies mee them when I am neere you. Me, ſayd ſhe, preſently? Think you well, <hi>Hylas,</hi> of what you ſay? Yes: of you (replied I) and beleeue you not, but I haue well thought of what I ſay, before I durſt vtter it. If I thought theſe words were true, I will ſpeake to you in another ſort. If you doubt (ſayd I) that theſe words be true, caſt your eyes on your perfection, and you ſhall be fully aſſured. And then with a thouſand oathes, I told her all that I had in my heart. Shee without being moued, anſwered me very coldly, <hi>Hylas,</hi> accuſe not that which is in me, for your owne follies: for I know well to remedy it, ſo that you ſhall haue no cauſe: as for the reſt, ſince the loue which my mother beares you, nor the condition wherein I am, cannot turne you from your bad intent, beleeue that, that which duty cannot worke in you, it ſhall in me; and that I will auoide all manner occaſions for you, to continue that you ſhall know I am ſuch as I ought to be, you ſee how coldly I ſpeake to you: it is not for that I feele not ſencibly enough your indiſcretion, but to let you know, that paſſion tranſports me not, but that reaſon only makes me ſpeake thus, that if I ſee that this meane will nothing preuaile to alter your deſſine, I will after run to ſome more extreme. Theſe words deliuered with ſuch coldneſſe, touched me more to the quicke, then I can tell you: yet could not this withdraw mee: for I knew well, that the firſt skirmiſhes are ordinarily maintained in this faſhion. But by chance, when <hi>Aymee</hi> ſeeing me without words, and ſo aſtonied, turned away without ſaying more, there was one of her companions, that ſeeing me ſo mated, came towards me; and blowing her noſe, paſſed by twice or thrice with her hand before her eyes, and afterwards began to run, as if ſhee had allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee to run after her. At the firſt, I was ſo amazed with the blow, I made as though I heeded it not: but when ſhe came back the ſecond time,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:177519:135"/>
I fell on running after her: and ſhe, after ſhe had ſomewhat run about her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions, ſtarted from them; and when ſhe was a litle from them, faining to bee out of breath, lay downe behind a thicke buſh. I that at firſt ran without any deſſine, ſeeing her on the ground, and in a place where ſhee might not bee ſeene, ſeeming deſirous to bee reuenged for the paine ſhee had put mee to, began to clap her: whereto ſhee made a ſmall reſiſtance, but ſo, that ſhe ſhewed this priuacy diſpleaſed her not, eſpecially for that ſeeming to defend her, ſhe diſcouered purpoſely, as I thinke, to make her white skin ſeeme whiter by much, then one would iudge by her face. At laſt being riſen vp, ſhe ſayd to mee, I did not thinke, <hi>Hylas,</hi> you had bene ſo rude a gameſter, otherwiſe I would not haue meddled with you. If this diſpleaſe you (ſaid I) I craue pardon: but if it be not ſo, I was neuer in my life better payd for my indiſcretion then now. How meane you that, ſayd ſhee? I meane, ſaid I, faire <hi>Floriante,</hi> that I neuer ſaw fairer then that I ſpied eene now. See, ſaid ſhee, what a lier you are! and at this word ſtrooke me gently on the cheeke, and ran backe to her companions. This <hi>Floriante</hi> was the daughter of an honeſt knight, that then was ſicke, and kept neere the ſhore of <hi>Arar:</hi> and ſhee hearing of her fathers ſickeneſſe, went to ſeeke him out, hauing ſtayed ſomewhile with one of her ſiſters, who was married in <hi>Arles:</hi> her face was not very faire, for ſhe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what browne: but ſhe had ſuch conceits, and was of ſo liuely an humor, that I muſt tell you, this meeting made me loſe the will I had to <hi>Aymee,</hi> and that ſo quickly, that I felt little diſpleaſure in leauing her; ſo that the contentment in finding this, cleered me of all griefe. I then forſooke <hi>Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee,</hi> me thought, and addicted my ſelfe wholy vnto <hi>Floriante:</hi> I may ſay me thought; for it was not true altogether, ſeeing that often when I ſaw her, I tooke pleaſure to talke with her, though the affection which I bare the other, drew me with a little more violence: but indeed when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſometime what I ſayd, I found, that whereas I was wont to loue but one, I did now ſerue two. It is true, that this was with no great paine: for when I was neere <hi>Floriante,</hi> I neuer remembred <hi>Aymee;</hi> and when I was neer <hi>Aymee, Floriante</hi> had no place in my memory. And ther was nothing ſo much tormented me, as when I was far from them both: for I was ſorry for them both together. Now, gentle <hi>Paris,</hi> this entertainement laſted with me to <hi>Vienna;</hi> but being by chance at our lodging (for almoſt euery night we went aſhore, and ſpecially when we paſſed by any good townes) lo, there comes a ſhepherdeſſe to intreat the maſter of the boate where I was, to let her haue a place, as farre as <hi>Lyons,</hi> becauſe her husband being wounded by ſome enemies, had ſent vnto her to ſeeke him out. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:177519:136"/>
who was curteous, receiued her willingly, &amp; ſo the next morning ſhe placed her ſelfe in the boate with vs. Shee was faire, but ſomodeſt and diſcreet, that ſhe was to be no leſſe commended for her vertue: otherwiſe ſo ſad and full of melancholy, that ſhe moued pitty from all the company. And becauſe I haue alwayes had much compaſſion on the afflicted, I had it infinitely ouer this, &amp; endeuored to comfort her the beſt I could: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Floriante</hi> was not contented, what countenance ſoeuer ſhe ſet on it, nor <hi>Aimee</hi> neither: for conceiue (gentle <hi>Paris)</hi> that though a woman diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble, yet ſhee cannot chooſe but feele the loſſe of a louer; for that it ſeemeth to be a wrong to her beauty; and beauty being the thing that this Sexe moſt eſteemes, is the moſt ſenſible part in her. Yet I that with my compaſſion beganne to mingle a little loue, not ſeeming to looke on thoſe two wenches, I held on talke with her; and among other things, to the end our diſcourſe might not fayle, and to haue the greater know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of her, I intreated her to tell me the cauſe of her ſorrow. She then full of courteſie, began to ſpeake thus:</p>
                  <p>The compaſſion which you haue of my paine, bindes me (courteous ſtranger) to giue you more ſatisfaction than that you demaund; and you would thinke it a great fault, if I refuſed ſo ſmall a thing. But I beſeech you to conſider withall, the ſtate wherein I am, and to excuſe my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if I abridge it as much as I can. Know then (ſhepheard) that I was borne about the bankes of <hi>Loyre,</hi> where I was as charily brought vp to the age of fifteene yeeres, as one of my ſort might be. My name is <hi>Cloris,</hi> and my father is called <hi>Leonce,</hi> the brother of <hi>Gereſtan,</hi> into whoſe hands I was deliuered, after the death of my father and my mother, being of the age I told you, and from that time I beganne to feele the blowes of Fortune; for my vncle hauing more care of his owne children than of me, thought himſelfe ouer-layd with my charge. All the comfort I had, was from his wife called <hi>Collire,</hi> for ſhe loued me, and prouided for what ſhe could poſſibly, without her husbands knowledge. But the heauens would afflict mee in all: for when <hi>Filander</hi> the brother of <hi>Collire</hi> was ſlaine, ſhe tooke ſuch a griefe, that none could perſwade her to ſuruiue him; ſo that within few dayes after, ſhe dyed, and I abode with her two daughters, who were ſo young, that I had little contentment to be with them. It fell out, that a ſhepheard of the prouince of <hi>Vienna,</hi> named <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> came to viſit the Temple of <hi>Hercules,</hi> that ſtands on the ſhore of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran,</hi> on the top of a rocke that riſes in the midſt of the mountaines, much aboue them all that are there-about. On that day there were together a great company of vs young ſhepheardeſſes: For it was a ſolemne day for
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:177519:136"/>
for that place. I ſhould vſe but needleſſe words, to tell you the ſpeech we had together, and the faſhion wherewith he ſhewed me his loue. So it was, that from that day he gaue himſelfe to me ſo, that hee neuer made ſhew of contradicting it. He was young and goodly: for his wealth, he had much more than I might hope for; for the reſt, his ſpirit ſo like that which appeared outwardly in his body, and there was a perfect agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His ſuite laſted foure yeeres, and I cannot ſay, that in all that time, he either did, or thought any thing wherewith he acquainted me not, and asked my aduice.</p>
                  <p>This extreme ſubmiſſion ſo long continued, made mee moſt certaine of his loue; and his merits, which then had not a little bound mee to loue him, haue ſince that time wonne me in ſuch a faſhion, that I may ſay with truth, there was nothing in the world better beloued, then <hi>Roſidor</hi> was of <hi>Cloris,</hi> with which he thought himſelfe ſo ſtrongly tyed to me, that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his affection, if it could haue beene increaſed. We liued ſo, more then a yeere, with all the delight that ſo perfect a loue might bring to two Louers.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, the heauens ſeemed willing to make vs intirely contented, &amp; ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, that al the difficulties which impeached our mariage, were remoued. Behold vs now as happy as mortals might be! for wee were led into the Temple, the voyce of <hi>Hymen, Hymene,</hi> ſounding on all ſides.

We were then at <hi>Vienna,</hi> where are the moſt part of the <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors</hi> poſſeſſions. It fell out, that ſome forlorne young men of the villages without Lyoas, on that ſide where our Druides went to lay the Guy, where they had vſed it in the forreſts of <hi>Mars,</hi> called <hi>Ayrieu,</hi> meant to commit ſome diſorder: my husband not able to brooke it, after hee had gently admoniſhed them, empeached them for executing it: where at they were ſo enraged, that thinking the greateſt offence they could doe to <hi>Roſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,</hi> was to hurt me; there was one of them about to throw a vyole of inke at my face: but ſeeing it comming, I turned my head aſide, ſo that I was not touched but on my necke, as (ſaid ſhe ſtooping downe) you may yet ſee the markes plaine. My husband, that ſaw my breſt full of ynke and blood, thinking I had beene grieuouſly wounded; and beſides, conceiuing this outrage to be ſo great, that taking his ſword into his hand, he ſtrucke it thorow the body of him that gaue the blow, and then thruſting among the others, with the helpe of his friends, hee draue them out of his houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="280" facs="tcp:177519:137"/>
Iudge, ſhepheard, if I were troubled: for I thought I was worſe hurt then indeede I was, and ſaw my husband beſmeared with the blood of him whom he ſlew, as alſo of a wound which he had on his ſhoulder. But when this firſt fray was in part paſſed, and by that the wound was dreſſed, and he apparelled, the Iuſtice came to ſeize on him, and carried him away with ſuch violence, that they would not ſuffer mee to bid him farewell: but my affection more ſtrong then their defence, made me way at laſt to him; and caſting my ſelfe on his necke, claſped ſo faſt about, that it was as much as they could doe to put me off. He on the other ſide, when hee ſaw me in this caſe, deſiring rather to dye then to be ſeparated from me, vſed all the violence which a great courage and an extreme loue was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to worke, which was ſuch, that all wounded as hee was, he got him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe out of their hands, and went out of the Towne.</p>
                  <p>This defence kept him from being a priſoner, but it made his cauſe the worſe with the Iudge, who in the mean time ſent out threatnings and Proclamations: during all which, his greateſt diſpleaſure was, that hee could not be with me; and becauſe that deſire preſſed him fore, he diſgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelfe, and came to me one euening, and paſſed all the night with me. God knowes what my contentment was, but yet my feare was as great: for Iknew that they which purſued him, vnderſtanding the loue which was betweene vs, did all they could to ſurprize him; and it fell out as I alwaies feared: for at laſt he was found, and brought into <hi>Lyons,</hi> where preſently I followed him, and to good purpoſe for him, for that the Iudges whom at all houres I ſollicited, tooke ſuch pitty on me, that they ſhewed him fauour: and ſo, notwithſtanding all the purſuit of the aduerſaries, hee was ſet at liberty. If I found much ſorrow in this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and paine when I ſaw him, beleeue, courteous ſhepheard, that I had no leſſe ſatisfaction, to ſee him out of danger, and acquitted from all that had paſſed. But becauſe the diſpleaſure which he had receiued in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had made him ſicke, he was enforced to ſtay ſome dayes at <hi>Lyons:</hi> and I being alwaies about him, to giue him the beſt comfort I could; at laſt, being paſt the danger, he prayed me to ſet things in order at home, that we might entertaine our friends with that mirth that hee deſired, for the good ſucceſſe of his affaires: and behold, theſe diſſolute fellowes, who had beene the cauſe of all our paine, ſeeing they could haue no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, reſolued to kill him in his bed: and being entered into his lodging, gaue him 2. or 3. ſtabs with a ponyard, &amp; leuing him for dead, fled away. Alas! courteous ſhepheard, iudge what I ought to bee, and in what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was my ſoule like to be, that in truth is touched with the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:177519:137"/>
accident that could befall me.</p>
                  <p>So ended <hi>Cloris,</hi> hauing her face couered with teares, which ſeemed ſo many pearles that rowled downe her faire boſome. Now, gentle ſhepheard, that that I will tell you, is a new head-ſpring of Loue. The affection which I ſaw in this ſhepheardeſſe, touched mee with ſo much compaſſion, that though her face had not beene able to haue wonne my loue, yet the pitty ſtruck me ſo to the quick, that I muſt confeſſe, that <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, Stilliane, Aymee,</hi> nor <hi>Floriante,</hi> neuer tied me with a ſtronger chain then this deſolate <hi>Cloris:</hi> Which was not, for that I loued not the others, but I had yet beſides their place this voyde in my ſoule. Behold mee then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued into <hi>Cloris</hi> as well as into the others, but I knew well it was to no purpoſe to ſpeake to her, while <hi>Roſidor</hi> were either not dead, or not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for the paine wherein ſhe was, poſſeſſed her altogether. Wee came in this ſort to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where preſently euery one parted. It is true, that the new affection which I bare to <hi>Cloris,</hi> made me accompany her to her lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, where eſpecially I viſited <hi>Roſidor,</hi> to haue ſome acquaintance with him, iudging it beſt ſo to beginne, thereby to come to the good graces of his wife. She that thought him worſe hurt then ſhe found it (for they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies make the euil greater then it is, and the apprehenſion much encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the accident which they doubt) changed her countenance and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, when ſhe found him vp, and walking about his chamber. But, ſee what befell me! the ſadneſſe which <hi>Cloris</hi> had in the boat, was (as I tolde you) the cauſe of my affection: and when being neere <hi>Roſidor,</hi> I ſaw her ioyfull and content, look how the compaſſion had made this loue to grow, ſo alſo her ioyfulneſſe and contentment cauſed it to dye: proouing well as then, that euery euill ought to be cured by the contrary. I entred then a ſlaue and captiue into that lodging, and I came out a freeman, and maſter of my ſelfe. But conſidering this accident, I endeuoured to remember <hi>Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee</hi> and <hi>Floriante,</hi> and preſently wiſhed to finde them at their lodging; and turning on all hands, at laſt I met them by fortune together.</p>
                  <p>A good meeting: the next day was the great Feaſt of <hi>Venus,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, according to cuſtome, the day before the ſolemnity, the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſing in the Temple, the Hymnes which are made in the honour of the Goddeſſe; and they watch there vntill midnight: I heard them reſolue with the mother of <hi>Aymee,</hi> to paſſe the night as the others, that ſhee might the better performe her vow. <hi>Floriante</hi> at the ſecret requeſt of <hi>Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mee,</hi> promiſed to doe ſo too. And becauſe they ſtayed there a great liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I had a deſigne, without any ſpeech of it to goe in likewiſe, fayning to be a wench, when it ſhould be darke: but knowing that the Druides

were themſelues at the gate, when it waxed darke, I purpoſed to hide my ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple was ſhut vp, and there were no more men but my ſelfe, vnleſſe there were ſome that were as curious as I: and by that time the Hymnes had long continued, I came out of my lurking place. And becauſe the Temple was great, and there was no light but that which the tapers lighted on the Altar, might giue all about, I eaſily fet my ſelfe among the weaches, without their knowledge: and as I was ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching with mine eyes for that part where <hi>Aymee</hi> might bee, I ſaw a little candle brought to a young wench, who riſing vp, went with it to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and after di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I know not whether it were for that the light was dimme (for ſometimes they will helpe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by hiding the imperfection of the painting) or that indeed ſhe were faire: yet ſo it was, that aſſoon as I ſaw her, I loued her. Let them now tell me that ſay that loue comes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eyes of the partie beloued, that canont be: for ſhee could not ſee me; beſides that, ſhee turned not her eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me; and hardly could I behold her ſo well, that I might know her another time: and that was the cauſe that I thruſt forward: by curioſity I crept gently among thoſe ſhepheardeſſes that were next her. But by miſ-hap, beeing (with greater danger) come hard by her, ſhee ended her Hymne, and ſent backe the taper where it was wont to bee: ſo that the place was ſo darke, that hardly (though I might touch her) could I ſee her.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, the hope that ſhe or ſome other neere her, might beginne againe to ſing, I ſtayed there a while. But I ſaw to the contrary, that the taper was carried into the other Quire, and preſently after, one of thoſe that were there, beganne to ſing, as my new and vnknowne miſtriſſe had done. The difference that I noted, whether in voyce, or face, was great; for ſhe had nothing that came neere her whom I beganne to loue: which was the cauſe, that beeing no longer able to command my curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I went to a Dame that was ſome what farre off, and counterfeiting the beſt I could, I asked what ſhe was that ſung before the laſt. You muſt be a ſtranger (ſaid ſhe) if you know her not. It may be, I know her (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I) if heard her name.

                     </gap>: but at that time, not remembring where I was, after many other thanks, I ſaid to her, that if in exchange of the paine that ſhe had taken, I could yeeld her any ſeruice, I did not thinke any man happier then I was.</p>
                  <p>How now (ſaid ſhe) who are you that talke in this faſhion? And looking more hee defully on mee, ſhee knew by my habit what I was. Whereat, all aſtonied (ſaid ſhee) How come you to haue the hardineſſe to breake our lawes in this ſort? Know you not, that you cannot pay this fault but with the loſſe of your life? I muſt tell you true, that though I knew there was chaſtiſement ordained, yet I did not thinke it was ſuch, whereat I was not a little aſtonied, yet alledging vnto her that I was a ſtranger, and knew not their Statutes, ſhe tooke pitty on me, and ſaid, that from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſhe well perceiued it; and that I muſt know that it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to obtaine pardon for this fault, for that the law was ſo rigorous, to free thoſe watches from all the abuſes which were wont to bee commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding, ſeeing that I came not of any wicked intent, ſhee would doe what ſhe could to ſaue me. And therefore I was not to tarry till the mid-night bell rang, for then the Druides came to the gate with their torches, and looked them all in the face. That now the gate of the Temple was ſhut, but ſhe would attempt to open it: and then caſting a vaile ouer my head, which couered me to the hanches, ſhe fitted my cloak ſo vnderneath it, that it could not be diſcerned in the night from a gown: and hauing thus dreſſed mee, ſhee told ſome of her neighbours, who came with her, that ſhee was not well: and they all went to require the key of the moſt ancient of the company; and wee going together towards the gate with a little waxe-candle onely, which her ſelfe bare, and which ſhe almoſt couered with her hand, fayning, as if ſhe would preſerue it from the winde, we went out of the preaſe: and thus happily I eſcaped out of this danger through her courteſie: and the better to diſguiſe me, &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, for the deſire I had to know to whom I was ſo much bound, I went with the other to her lodging.</p>
                  <p>But faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſayd he) turning to <hi>Diane,</hi> this diſcourſe is yet but halfe done, and me thinkes the Sunne is downe long ſince; will it not be fit to referre the reſt to another time, when we haue more leiſure? You haue reaſon ſayd ſhe (gentle ſhepheard) one muſt not ſpend all his goods at once: that which remaines, may cauſe vs make another pleaſing iourney; beſides that <hi>Paris,</hi> who is to paſſe the riuer, cannot ſtay longer
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:177519:139"/>
without committing himſelfe to the night. There is nothing (ſaid he, faire ſhepheardeſſe) that can trouble mee, when I am neere you. I wiſh (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe) there were any thing in me that might pleaſe you; for your worth and courteſie binde euery one to yeeld you all ſorts of ſeruice. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> would haue replied, but <hi>Hylas</hi> interrupted him, when he ſaid: I would to God, gentle <hi>Paris,</hi> that I were you, and that <hi>Diane</hi> were <hi>Phillis,</hi> and that ſhe would vſe this language to me. When that ſhall be (ſaid <hi>Paris)</hi> you ſhall haue but the more obligation to her. It is true (ſaid <hi>Hylas)</hi> but I ſhall not be afraid to binde my ſelfe in part to her, to whom I am alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſo entirely. Your obligations (ſaid <hi>Diane)</hi> are not of thoſe that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for euer, you can reuoke them when you will. If the one (anſwered he) bring loſſe, the others haue aduantage; and aske <hi>Phillis</hi> if ſhe be not well eaſed, that I am of that humour: for if I were otherwiſe, ſhe might make ſome account of my ſeruice. With the like diſcourſe <hi>Diane, Paris &amp;</hi> many other ſhepheardeſſe; came to the great medow, where they vſed to meet before they went home; and <hi>Paris</hi> giuing the good night to <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane,</hi> and the reſt of the company, tooke his way by the ſide of <hi>Laigneu.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in the meane time <hi>Licidas</hi> was talking with <hi>Phillis;</hi> for the ielouſie of <hi>Siluander</hi> had tormented him ſo, that he could not ſtay vntill the next morning, to tell her what was in his heart. He was ſo farre beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, that he tooke no heed who heard him; but thinking he had beene alone with her, after two or three great ſighs he ſayd; Is it poſſible, <hi>Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis,</hi> that the heauens haue preſerued my life ſo long, to feele thy vnfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſſe? The ſhepheardeſſe that looked for ſome other diſcourſe, was ſo ſurprized, that ſhe could not anſwer him. And the ſhepheard ſeeing her mute, and thinking it was to inuent ſome excuſe, went on. You haue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon (faire ſhepheardeſſe) not to anſwer, for your eies ſay as much indeed, too plainely for my quie: And this ſilence tells and aſſures mee but too well of what I demand, and which I would not know.

let vs ſee what they are: or if you will not do it, giue backe, ſhepheard, without accuſing me of the errour which you haue committed, and for which I ſhall doe long penance: but let it content you, to leaue the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diſpleaſure, but not the blame which you goe about to raiſe by your ordinary complaynts, where with you importune both heauen and earth.</p>
                  <p>The doubt which I haue had (replyed the ſhepheard) makes me com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine, but the aſſurance which you giue mee by your egre words, makes me die. And what is your feare (anſwered the ſhepheardeſſe?) Iudge, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed he, if it may be ſmall, ſince the complaints that proceed of it, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune both heauen and earth, as you caſt in my teeth. If you will know it, I will tell you in few words. I feare that <hi>Phillis</hi> loueth not <hi>Lieidas.</hi> Yet, ſhepheard (ſayd <hi>Phillis)</hi> you may thinke I loue you not, and beare in your memory what I haue done for you, and for <hi>Olympe.</hi> Is it poſſible that the actions of my life paſſed, ſhould returne before your eyes, when you conceiue theſe doubts? I know well (anſwered the ſhepheard) that you haue loued me; and if I had beene in doubt, my payne ſhould not be ſuch as I now ſeele: but I feare that a wound, as great as it is, if it bring not death, may heale in time: ſo that which Loue hath made you do for me, is by this time ſo fully healed, that hardly the skarre onely may be ſeene. <hi>Phillis</hi> at theſe vvords turning her head aſide, and her eyes with a playne geſture of diſcontentment: Since, ſhepheard, (ſaid ſhe) that vntill novv by the offices and thoſe teſtimonies of affection vvhich I haue done you, I perceiue, I haue got nothing, aſſure your ſelfe, that which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine moſt of, is the paine, and time which I haue employed about it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Licidas</hi> knevv vvell the ſhepheardeſſe was much mooued, but himſelfe vvas ſo ouercome of ielouſie, that he could not hold from anſvvering her. This anger (ſhepheardeſſe) giues me, but more knovvledge of that vvchich I feared; for to trouble ones ſelfe for the ſpeech vvhich an ouer-great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection hat ſometime brought out, is it not a ſigne he vvas neuer tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched? <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing this reproach, came a little to her ſelfe, and turning her face to him; You ſee, <hi>Licidas,</hi> all diſſembling diſpleaſes me in any, but I cannot beare it in them with whom I would liue. How now? hath <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidas</hi> the hardneſſe to tell me, that he doubts the loue of his <hi>Phillis,</hi> and I not thinke hee diſſembles? and vvhat teſtimony may be giuen, that I haue not giuen you? Shepheard, ſhepheard, beleeue me, theſe words make me thinke hardly of the aſſurance which ſometimes you haue giuen me of your affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For it may be, you deceiue me in that which concerns you, as it ſeemes you deceiue your ſelfe in that that touches me; or as you think you are not beloued, being, indeed, more then the reſt of the world:
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:177519:140"/>
ſo you imagine you loue, when indeed, you doe not. Shepheardeſſe (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Licidas)</hi> if my affection were of that common ſort, that haue more of apparence then of effect, I would condemne my ſelfe, when the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of it did tranſport mee beyond reaſon, or when I demand of you great proofes of a great amity: but ſince it is not of that kinde, and that you know well it imbraces whatſoeuer is greater, know you not that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme loue neuer goes without this feare, though it haue no cauſe? and for the little it hath, this feare changes it ſelfe into iealouſie, and iealouſie into paine, or rather into madneſſe, wherein I finde my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>While <hi>Licidas</hi> and <hi>Phillis</hi> talked thus, thinking their words were heard but of them two, and that they had no other witneſſes, but the trees, <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uander</hi> (as I told you) lay like a skout, and loſt not a word. <hi>Laonice</hi> on the other ſide, which had beene aſleepe in that place, awaked at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of their ſpeech; and knowing them both, was infinitely glad to be found to ſo good purpoſe, aſſuring her ſelfe, that they would not part vntill they had acquainted her with much of their ſecrets, where with ſhe hapned to ſerue her owne turne to their ruine. And it fell out as ſhe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; for <hi>Phillis</hi> hearing <hi>Licidas</hi> ſay that he was iealous, demaunded very loude, both of whom and wherefore? Shepheardeſſe (anſwered the foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <hi>Licidas)</hi> aske you me that queſtion? Tell me, I pray you, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded that great coldneſſe towards me of late, and from whence that familarity which you haue in ſo ſtrait a ſort with <hi>Siluander,</hi> if the loue which you were wont to beare me, be not changed to his benefit? Ah ſhepheardeſſe! you may well thinke, that my heart is without feeling of your blowes, ſince it hath ſo liuely felt thoſe of your eyes. How long is it ſince to talke you haue withdrawne your ſelfe from me, ſince you took no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to talke with me; and that it ſeemed you ſend about for other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, that you may auoyde mine? Or, where is the care you were wont to haue of my buſineſſe, or the griefe which my ſtay from your preſence brought you? You may remember how ſvveete the name of <hi>Licidas</hi> hath beene to you, and hovv often it ſlipped out of your mouth, for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of your heart, when you meant to name ſome other. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your ſelfe, I ſay, and haue at this time nothing in the ſame heart, and in the ſame mouth, but the name and affection of <hi>Siluander,</hi> with whom you liue in ſuch aſort, that there is not ſo great a ſtranger in our Country but knovves that you him. And thinke you it ſtrange, that I which am the ſame <hi>Licidas,</hi> which I haue alvvayes yet beene, and was not borne but onely for you <hi>Phillis,</hi> haue entred into ſome doubt of you?</p>

                  <p>MY father (for ſo ſhe called him) bee not moued, I beſeech you, to heare that which I haue to ſay to you, and when you haue occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, remember that the ſame loue cauſed this, which at ſome other time hath driuen you to the like or more ſtrange accidents. I durſt not ſpeake to you of it, if I had not a commiſſion, namely, if I had not bene comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: but <hi>Galathee,</hi> whom this buſineſſe concernes, is willing, ſince ſhee hath choſen you as the Phiſicion for this ſickneſſe, that you ſhould know both the breeding, and the proceeding; yet hath ſhe enioyned me to draw ſome words from you, that you will neuer ſpeake of it. The Druide, which well knew what reſpect hee was to beare to his Lady (for ſo hee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed her) anſwered that hee had wiſedome enough to conceale that, which he knew might concerne <hi>Galathee;</hi> &amp; that therein the promiſe was more then needed. Vpon this aſſurance (continued <hi>Leonide)</hi> I will attempt to tel you, what you are to know. It is now a long time, ſince <hi>Polemas</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:177519:141"/>
to be in loue with <hi>Galathee:</hi> to tell you how it grew, were vnprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: ſo it was, that he loued her, ſo that in earneſt one might call him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous. This affection paſſed on ſo far, that <hi>Galathee</hi> her ſelfe could not be ignorant of it, ſo much it wanted, that in particular, ſhee made it diuers times appeare, that his ſeruice was not diſpleaſing to her, which tied him ſo faſt, that nothing ſince could euer withhold him; and without doubt, <hi>Galathee</hi> had ſome good occaſion to fauour <hi>Polemas,</hi> for he was a man that merited much: for his race, you know hee is of the ancient ſtocke of <hi>Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> that in nobility giues not place to that of <hi>Galathee:</hi> as for his perſon, he is very louely, hauing both a face and faſhion able to win loue: aboue all hee hath great knowledge, yet aſhamed of it before the wiſeſt. But why go I about to tell you theſe things? Your father knows them better then I. So it was, that theſe good conditions made him ſo commendable, that <hi>Galathee</hi> vouchſafed to fauour him more then any other in the court of <hi>Amaſis:</hi> yet it was with that diſcretion, that no man noted it. Now <hi>Polemas</hi> hauing the wind ſo fauorable, liued with that contentment to himſelfe, as a man founded vpon hopes might. But this inconſtant Loue, or rather this inconſtant Fortune, which delights in change, as in her nouriſhment, was willing that <hi>Polemas,</hi> as well as the reſt of the world, ſhould feele what the ſtripes are, that come from her hand: you may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that it is ſomewhile ſince <hi>Amaſis</hi> permitted <hi>Clidaman</hi> to beſtow vs on his ſeruants: from this occaſion, as from a ſwarme, haue iſſued ſo many loues, that beſides that the court was peſtered with them, all the country feeles them.</p>
                  <p>Now among others, by chance <hi>Lindamor</hi> was giuen to <hi>Galathee,</hi> hee hath much worth, yet ſhe receiued him ſo coldly, as the ceremony of that feaſt would ſuffer. But he that before, it may bee, had ſome ſuch intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he durſt not make ſhew of, beyond the bounds of his diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was well pleaſed, that this ſubiect preſented it ſelfe ſo luckily, to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock thoſe deſſines, which loue had made him conceale, and to giue birth, vnder the vaile of that fiction, to moſt true paſſions. If <hi>Polemas</hi> felt the beginning of this new loue, the progreſſe of it was trobleſome to him, for that the beginning was couered with the ſhaddow of courteſie, and the example of all the other Nymphs; ſo that though <hi>Galathee</hi> entertained him with that apparancy of delight, yet in reaſon that might not offend him, becauſe ſhee was tied to it by the law, which was common; but when this ſuite continued, and more then that, when paſſing the limits of courteſie, he ſaw that it was in good earneſt, then hee felt the effects which ielouſie workes in the ſoule that truly loues. <hi>Galathee,</hi> for her part
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:177519:142"/>
little thought, or at leaſt beleeued not, it was ſo far gone, but the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as threeds ſowed together, draw the one to the other, carried him ſo far, that <hi>Polemas</hi> may be in ſome ſort excuſed, if he would ſuffer himſelfe to be wounded with ſo ſharpe a blade; and if ielouſie could do more then the aſſurance which his ſeruices might giue him. <hi>Lindamor</hi> was gentle, &amp; there was nothing which you could wiſh in a perſon welborn, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was not furniſhed; courteous among the Ladies, braue among the warriours, full of valour, and courage, as any that hath beene in our court theſe many yeeres. He was about 25. yeeres of age, without fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the effects which loue is vſed to worke in harts of that age, not for that out of nature he could not ſerue Ladies, or that hee wanted courage to hazard any one; but becauſe he was alwayes buſied in exerciſes, which driue out idleneſſe, he had not giuen leaſure to his affections to fixe their roots in his ſoule, for from the time he was able to beare armes, thruſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with that generous inſtinct, that carries noble courages to the moſt dangerous enterpriſe, he let paſſe no occaſion of warre wherein he gaue not witneſſe of what he was. Afterward being returned to ſee <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi> to perform duty to him to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was obliged, at the ſame time he gaue himſelfe to two, to <hi>Clidaman,</hi> as to his Lord, and to <hi>Galathee,</hi> as to his Lady, and to them both without receiuing diſgrace.</p>
                  <p>But the courteſie of young <hi>Clidaman,</hi> and the merits of <hi>Galathee</hi> had too great power ouer thoſe Louers, to be drawn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their ſeruice. Behold then (as I tell you) <hi>Lindamor</hi> become amorous, but ſo, that his affection could no longer be hidden with the vaile of courteſie. <hi>Polemas,</hi> as he that had intereſt, found it out ſoone enough: yet though they were friends, would he make no ſhew of it, but to the contrary, kept it cloſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: hee laboured nothing more, then to get more aſſurance of this Loue, to the end he might ruine him by all the tricks he could, as he tried afterward. And becauſe ſince the returne of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he had (as I told you) made profeſſion of friendſhip to him, hee thought fit to continue it. About this time, <hi>Clidaman</hi> beganne to delight in Tourneys and Tiltings, wherein he profited well (as they ſayd) for a beginner. But aboue all, <hi>Lindamor</hi> bare away the glory of the goodlieſt and gentleſt; wherat <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> was ſo vexed, that he could not diſſemble his ill will, and he thought that if he made a match with him, he might carry away the greater glory, for that being older, and of longer abode in Court, he was alwais in al the deſignes of his Riuall: but <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that ſuſpected not the occaſions that made him do ſo, went on freely, and that made his actions more pleaſing, which <hi>Polemas</hi> did not, who had a ſecret purpoſe where he muſt vſe ſome

                  </p>
                  <p>The Nymph, that then beganne to haue eyes as well for other men, as till then ſhee had for none but <hi>Polemas,</hi> could not containe from ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king much to the good of <hi>Lindamor.</hi> And ſee how Loue mocks and ſports with the wiſedome of Louers! That which with ſuch care and craft <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi> went about, ſeeking to aduance himſelfe aboue <hi>Lindamor,</hi> hurts himſelfe the more, and makes him almoſt his inferiour: for euery one comparing their actions together, found ſuch difference, that it had bin better for him either not to haue aſſiſted him, or to haue bin declared his enemy at once. It was that very euening that <hi>Lindamor</hi> thruſt forward by his good Angell, (I thinke, for my part, there be good dayes, and vnhappy dayes) auowed himſelfe, in earneſt, ſeruant to the faire <hi>Galathee;</hi> but the occaſion was alſo as good as he could wiſh: for, dancing a dance which the Frankes haue lately brought out of <hi>Germany,</hi> where one goes to take away her whom he likes, led on by loue, but rather ſpurred to it (as I thinke) by deſtiny, he tooke away <hi>Galathee</hi> from <hi>Polemas,</hi> who more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiue to his diſcourſe then to the dance, tooke little heede, and was at that time reproaching the Nymph for the new breeding loue which hee fore-ſaw of <hi>Lindamor.</hi> Shee, who till then neuer thought him to bee in earneſt, offended at his diſcourſe, tooke his words in ſo ill part, that ſhee told him what words <hi>Lindamor</hi> had vſed, which were ſo much the more pleaſing, for that ſhe thought ſhee was thereby reuenged of him for his ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>That which makes me ſpeake thus, is, for that there is none that may know more then I, who may ſeeme to bee deſtined to heare of all theſe Loues: for as ſoon as we were withdrawne, and that <hi>Galathee</hi> was in bed, ſhe willed me to ſtand at the beds head, and hold the light, while ſhe read the diſpatches that came to her, and ſpecially thoſe of importance. That night ſhe cauſed the Nymphs to leaue her alone: and when they were all gone, ſhe commanded me to locke the doore, then made me ſit at the beds feete, and after ſhe had ſmiled a while, ſhee ſaid, You cannot chooſe but laugh, <hi>Leonide,</hi> at the gracious accident that befell me at the daunce. You know it is ſomewhile ſince <hi>Polemas</hi> had a minde to ſerue me, for I concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it not from you; and for as much as me thought he carried himſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me with that honour and reſpect (I neede not lye) his ſeruice was

not vnpleaſing to me, and re<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiued it with a better liking, then from any others in the Court, not that hee had yet any loue of my part: I will not ſay but that it may bee (as Loue alwaies flatters his patients with hope) he imagined that which he deſired: but the truth is, that I neuer yet iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that he had neuer any thing able to make mee loue him.

                  <p>Now <hi>Polemas</hi> ſeeing that I heard what he would ſay, and that I har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened to it with patience, being there by made the more hardy, not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that I liued with others in the ſame ſort, is gone ſo far, that he knows not what he does, he is ſo much beſide himſelfe. And indeede, this night he daunced with me ſome while, at the firſt ſo chiding, that I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained (without thinking of it) to aske him what the matter was. Shall it not diſpleaſe you (ſaid he) if I diſcouer it? No, anſwered I, for I neuer aske for the thing I would not know. Vpon this aſſurance he went for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
                  <p>I muſt tell you, Madame, that it is not in my power, not to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded at the actions which I ſee ordinarily before mine eyes, and which touch me ſo to the quicke, that if I had as great aſſurance, as I haue ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I know not if there were any thing able to keep me aliue. In ſadnes I was yet ſo ſimple, that I knew not what he would ſay; yet thinking his loue had tied mee to ſome ſort of curioſity, I asked what actions thoſe were that touched him ſo to the quicke. Then pawſing a little, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtedfaſtly on me, he ſayd: Is it poſſible, Madame, that without ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you aske me this? And why (anſwered I) would you not haue me do ſo? Becauſe (added he) it is you whom all theſe things concerne, and it is from you that they proceed; and then ſeeing that I ſpake not a word, (for I knew not what he would ſay) he beganne togoe on, and told mee, I would not haue you diſſemble in this buſineſſe, without bluſhing. For reſolutely I will enforce my ſelfe to tell you, though the diſcourſe coſt me my life. You know (Madame) with what affection, ſince the heauens made me yours, I haue indeuoured to giue proofe that I was truely the ſeruant of the faire <hi>Galathee:</hi> you can tell, if euen vntill-now you haue knowne any action of mine tended to other end than your ſeruice. If all my deſſignes haue not taken that poynt for their marke; and if all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires ariſing from thence, haue not ſhevved themſelues ſatisfied and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, I aſſure my ſelfe, that if my fortune deny me to deſerue any thing more in ſeruing you, yet at the leaſt ſhe will not refuſe me this ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from you, that you will confeſſe, that truly I am yours, and no others
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:177519:143"/>
but yours. Now if this be ſo, iudge what griefe I ought to haue, after ſo much time ſpent (not to ſay, loſt) when (if there be any reaſon in Loue, I ought with greater reaſon to haue expected ſome reward of my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: I ſee another fauoured in my place, and an inheritour (as I may ſay) of my goods before my death. Excuſe mee for ſpeaking in this manner: the extreme paſſion drawes theſe iuſt complaints out of my ſoule, which though it would, yet can it not longer be ſilent, ſeeing he that triumphs ouer me, hath got the victory, rather by deſtiny than merit. It is <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> of whom I ſpeake; <hi>Lindamor,</hi> whoſe ſeruice is the more happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued of you, by that that he is to giue me place, both in affection and faithfulneſſe. My griefe is not to ſee him more happy than he durſt wiſh for: but indeed to ſee him ſo at my coſt. Excuſe me, Madame, I beſeech you, or rather accuſe the greatneſſe of my affection, if I complayne, ſince it is but a more manifeſt proofe of the power which you haue ouer your moſt humble ſeruant.</p>
                  <p>And that which makes me ſpeake ſo, is, that I note you vſe towards him the ſame words, and the ſame faſhion of treaty that you did towards me, at the firſt breeding of your goodwill, and when you permitted me to ſpeake to you, and that I might ſay to my ſelfe, you knew mine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
                  <p>This putteth mee ſo farre beſides my ſelfe, with ſuch violence, that hardly can I commaund ouer theſe furious extremities which you put me to, and which the offence bringeth to my ſoule, and can produce no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of diſcretion. He would haue ſayd more, but the paſſion wherein he was, ſo ſuddenly tooke from him his voyce, that it was impoſſible for him to hold on longer. If I were offended at his words, you may iudge, for they were both raſh and full of vanity, and not to be borne with: yet that I might not giue knowledge of this brabble to them that haue eyes, but to ſpie the actions of others, I was compelled to make him an anſwer a little leſſe eager than I had done, had I beene elſe-where: and I ſayd, <hi>Polemas,</hi> that which I am, and that which you are, will not ſuffer me to doubt that you are my ſeruant, ſo long as you ſtay in the houſe of my mother, and performe the ſeruice of my brother; but I cannot won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der enough at the follies which you mixe in your diſcourſe, in talking of heritage, and of your goods. In that which is from my loue, I know not by what right you pretend yours.</p>
                  <p>My intention, <hi>Polemas,</hi> hath bene to loue you, and eſteeme you as your vertue deſerues, and you are not to imagine beyond that. And for that you talke of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> get out of that error, for if I vſe him as I haue done
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:177519:144"/>
you, you are to thinke I will doe ſo to all thoſe that heereafter ſhall merit it, without other deſigne greater then to loue and eſteeme him that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerues it, in what ſubiect ſoeuer it be found. And how, madame, ſaid I then interrupting her, thinke you this a gentle anſwer? I know not how you could haue honeſtly ſayd more: for indeed, it muſt be confeſſed hee is arrogant: but yet it may not be denied, but this arrogancy is bred in him, vpon ſome ſhew of reaſon. Of reaſon (anſwered the Nymph preſe ntly?) What reaſon can he alledge? Many, Madame, replied I, but to conceale them all but one, I may ſay to you, that truely you haue allowed him to ſerue in a more peculiar manner then any other. That is (ſaid <hi>Galathee)</hi> for that he pleaſed me more then the reſt of my brothers ſeruants. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it, madame, ſaid I, and ſeeing himſelfe ſo farre in your good graces, how could he hope for leſſe then to bee beloued of you? Hee had heard talke of ſo many examples of loue betweene vnequall perſons, that hee could not flatter himſelfe leſſe, then to hope the ſame for himſelfe, which he heard ſpoke of others, &amp; I remember, that vpon that ſubiect he made verſes which he ſung before you: it is ſome while ſince you commanded him to conceale his affection: they were theſe:</p>

                  <p>Then <hi>Adamas</hi> asked her: And how, <hi>Leonide?</hi> it ſeemes by the words of <hi>Galathee,</hi> that ſhe deſpiſed <hi>Polemas,</hi> and by theſe verſes there is no man but will iudge ſhe loued him, and that only he could not brooke with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that ſhe ſhould diſſemble! Father (replied <hi>Leonide)</hi> it is true that ſhe loued him, and ſhe had giuen him that proof, that if he gaue credit to it, hee was not ſo arrogant, but that one might very well haue thought him to be of ſmall vnderſtanding, if he did not beleeue it; and though ſhe would diſſemble with me, yet I know ſhe had drawne him by ſhewes and hopes of good will, whereof the earneſt was not ſo ſmall as the firſt, but that many others haue bene deceiued, and I know not, conſidering what aſſurances were giuen, that any would thinke ſhee would loſe them, and gaineſay her going forward, but he deſerued this chaſtiſement for his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulnes which he vſed to a Nymph, whoſe deceiued affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cryes ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, ſo that loue at laſt gaue an care: for without faining he is the moſt deceitfull, the moſt vnthankfull, and moſt vnworthy to be beloued for this miſprifall, of any vnder heauen, and deſerues not to be pittied, if hee now feele the griefe which other haue ſuffered for him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adamas</hi> ſeeing her ſo much moued againſt <hi>Polemas,</hi> demaunded who the Nymph was that hee deceiued, and ſaid, that ſhee was ſome of her friends, ſince ſhe tooke the offence ſo to the quicke. Then ſhee perceiued that ſhe had yeelded too much to her paſſion, and that vnawares ſhee had made knowne that which ſhee had kept ſo long ſecret; yet as ſhee had a quicke ſpirit, and that would not lie long in her fault, ſhe couered by her
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:177519:145"/>
diſſimulation, this errour ſo well, that <hi>Adamas</hi> then tooke no great heed to it. And how, my daughter (ſayd <hi>Adamas)</hi> know you not, that men liue with a purpoſe to ouercome and finiſh all that they vndertake, and that the loue which they make ſhew of to other women, is but to make the way eaſie? You may ſee, <hi>Leonide,</hi> that all loue is for the deſire of the thing that is wanting; and the deſire being ſatisfied, there is no more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; if there be no more deſire, there is no more loue: therefore you may behold, that they which will be long loued, are they that giue leaſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to the deſires of their louers. But (added <hi>Leonide)</hi> ſhe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I ſpake, is one of my particular friends, and I know, ſhe neuer treated with <hi>Polemas,</hi> but with as great coldneſſe as ſhe could. That likewiſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed <hi>Adamas,</hi> makes the deſire to be loſt; for deſire is nouriſhed with hope and fauours.</p>
                  <p>Now look how the match of the Lampe goes out when the oyle failes, ſo deſire dies, when the nouriſhment of it is put out: therefore it is, that we ſee ſo many loues are changed, ſome for too many, otherſome for too few fauours. But let vs returne to that you ſayd to <hi>Galathee;</hi> what was that that ſhe anſwered? If <hi>Polemas</hi> (anſwered <hi>Leonide)</hi> had had (ſaid ſhe to me) as much iudgement to meaſure himſelfe, as he had raſhneſſe to dare to loue me, he would haue taken theſe fauours as from my courteſie, and not from my loue. But (continued <hi>Galathee)</hi> this is nothing to the worth of the accident which befell at that time; for I had ſcarcely anſwered <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas,</hi> what you haue heard, but <hi>Lindamor</hi> following the courſe of the daunce, was come to ſnatch or robbe, and vvith that dexterity, that <hi>Polemas</hi> cou'd not auoyd it, and by that meanes not anſwer me, but with his eyes; but certainly, with a looke ſo frowning, that I know not how I held from laughter. As for <hi>Lindamor,</hi> whether he took heed to it, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing it, would not let it appeare, ſo it was, that preſently after he ſpake to me in that ſort, it had beene enough to haue made the poore <hi>Polemas</hi> madde, if he had heard it. Madame, ſayd he to me, is it poſſible that all things ſhould goe ſo quite contrary, and that ieſting ſhould turne to ſo true earneſt, and the preſages likewiſe which your eyes ſpeake of to me, when I behold them? <hi>Lindamor,</hi> ſaid I to him, ſo you may be puniſhed as you deſerued, if ieſting you meet with earneſt. This puniſhment, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered he, is ſo welcome to me, that I ſhould beſhrew my ſelfe, if I did not loue and cheriſh it, as the greateſt happineſſe that might befall mee. What meane you by that (ſayd I) for it may bee wee ſpeake of diuers things? I meane (ſayd hee) that in this courſe of the dance, I haue ſtolne away you, and in the truth of loue, you haue ſtolne from mee both ſoule
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:177519:145"/>
and heart. Then bluſhing a little, I anſwered him in choler, How now, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> what diſcourſe is this? remember you what I am, and what you are? I do ſo, Madam (ſayd he) and that is it that makes me ſpeake ſo vnto you, for are you not my Lady, and am not I your ſeruant? Yes (an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I) but not as you take it, for you ought to ſerue mee with reſpect, and not with loue: or if there be any affection, it ſhould grow out of your duty. He preſently replied, Madam, if I ſerue you not with reſpect, neuer was diuinity honored by a mortall man: but whether this reſpect bee the father, or childe of my affection, it concernes you but little, for I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, whatſoeuer you are to mee, to ſerue you, to loue you, and to adore you, and thinke not herein, that the duty whereto <hi>Clidaman</hi> by the law of the game hath ſubiected vs, is the cauſe, well it may be the couerture: but to conclude, your merits, your perfections, or to ſay true, my deſtiny giues me to you, and thereto I aſſent: for I muſt acknowledge, that what man ſoeuer ſees you, and loues you not, deſerues not the name of a man. Theſe words were deliuered with ſuch a vehemency, that he made it appeare to me, that he truly told me what was in his ſoule; &amp; behold, I pray you, this pleaſant encounter. I neuer heeded this affection, thinking that al he did, was in ſport, &amp; ſhould haue neuer perceiued it, but for the ielouſie of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas:</hi> but ſince I haue alwayes had an eye to <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and I ſhould not lie, I haue found him as well capable of loue as ielouſie: ſo that it ſeames, that the other hath whetted the knife, wherewith hee would cut the threed of the ſmall loue I beare him: for I know not how <hi>Polemas</hi> hath euer ſince ſo diſpleaſed mee in all his actions, that I could hardly endure him to bee neere me the reſt of that night. On the contrary, all that <hi>Lindamar</hi> did, came ſo kindly to mee, that I wonder I marked it no ſooner. I know not whether <hi>Polemas,</hi> by reaſon of his being croſſed, haue changed his behauiour, or whether the euill opinion which I haue conceiued of him, haue altered my eyes when I behold him: yet ſo it is, that either mine eyes ſee not as they were wont, or <hi>Polemas</hi> is no more the man hee was wont to be.</p>
                  <p>I muſt not lie to you, when <hi>Galathee</hi> ſpake in this ſort againſt him, I was no whit ſorry becauſe of his ingratitude: on the contrary, the more to hurt him, I ſayd, I do not wonder, Madam, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> is more welcome to you, then <hi>Polemas:</hi> for the qualitites and perfections of them both are not equall; euery one that ſees them, will giue the ſame iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that you do of them. It is true, that heere in I fore-ſee a great hurly burly, firſt, betweene them, and after betweene you and <hi>Polemas.</hi> And why (ſayd <hi>Galathee?)</hi> Are you of opinion he hath any power ouer my
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:177519:146"/>
actions or of <hi>Lindamors.</hi> Not for that (ſaid I) Madam, but I knew the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Polemas</hi> ſo well, that he will leaue nothing vnattempted, and wil remooue heauen and earth, to recouer the happineſſe that he thinkes hee hath loſt; and for it he will commit theſe follies which cannot be hidden, but to thoſe that will not ſee them, and ſo ſhall you haue diſpleaſure, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> be offended: and God graunt it fall not out worſe. No ſuch thing, <hi>Leonide,</hi> anſwered ſhe, if <hi>Lindamor</hi> loue me, he will do as I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund him; if he do not loue me, he will not care what <hi>Polemas</hi> doth: and as for him, if he paſſe the bounds of reaſon, I knovv hovv to reforme him: leaue that labour to me, for I can prouide well enough for that. At this word ſhe commaunded mee to draw the curtaine, and let her reſt, if at leaſt theſe new deſſeignes would ſuffer her. But at the breaking vp of the daunce, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who had noted what countenance <hi>Polemas</hi> had made when he tooke <hi>Galathee</hi> from him, had a conceit that he loued her. Notwithſtanding, hauing neuer perceiued any thing by his actions paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he would aske him the queſtion, reſolued, that if he found him in loue, he would indeuour to diuert himſelfe, for that he thought himſelfe ſome what bound to it, for the loue he made ſhew of, which hee thought to be vnfained; and ſo going to him, deſired he might haue a word with him in priuate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Polemas,</hi> who vſed al maner of cunning that a Courtier was capable of, paynted his face with a fained ſhew of good will, and ſaid, What is it that <hi>Lindamor</hi> is pleaſed to commaund of me? I neuer vſe commoundement (ſaid <hi>Lindamor)</hi> where my prayer onely may take place; and at this time I neede neither of them, but onely as a friend, demaund a thing of you which our friendſhip bindes you to tell me. What may it be (replyed <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas?)</hi> ſince our friendſhip ſo bindes me, you are to thinke that I will anſwer you with the ſame freedome that you deſire to know. This it is (replyed <hi>Lindamor)</hi> that I haue ſome while ſerued <hi>Galathee,</hi> as I was tied by the ordinance of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> at laſt, I am conſtrayned ſo to do by that of Loue. For it is true, that after I had long time ſerued her, by the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of that fortune that gaue mee to her, her merits haue ſince ſo wonne me, that my will hath ratified that gift with ſo great affection, that to draw backe, would be as much want of courage, as it is now arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to ſay, that I dare loue her. Yet the friendſhip which is betvveene you and me, hauing beene of longer date, than this of Loue, giues mee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution enough to tell you, that if you loue her, and haue any pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to her, I hope as yet to haue that povver of my ſelfe, that I can with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dravv, and giue proofe, that Loue is leſſe in me than Friendſhip, or at
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:177519:146"/>
leaſt, the follies of the one ſhall giue place vnto the Wiſedome of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Tell mee then frankely that which you haue in your ſoule, to the end that neither your friendſhip, nor mine, may complayne of our actions. That which I ſay, is not to diſcouer the ſecrets of your intentions: ſince I lay open to you mine, you are not to be afraid that I ſhould know yours: beſides that, the lawes of friendſhip commaund you, not to hide them from me; prouided, that not curioſity, but the deſire of preſeruing our goodwill, makes me demaund it of you. <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſpake to <hi>Polemas</hi> with the ſame freedome that a friend ſhould, poore and ignorant Louer, that thought he could ſince it in loue! On the contrary, the diſſembling <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas</hi> anſwered him; <hi>Lindamor,</hi> this faire Nymph, of whom you ſpeake, is worthy to be ſerued of all the world; but as for my ſelfe, I haue no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; yet this I will tell you, that as concerning loue, I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that euery one, for his part, ſhould do what he can. Then <hi>Lindamor</hi> repented that he had vſed a language ſo full of courteſie and reſpect, ſince he required it ſo ill. Here ſolued to doe his beſt to aduance himſelfe into the good graces of the Nymph; and yet hee anſwered him, Since you haue no ſuch deſſigne, I am right glad, as of the thing moſt welcome to mee, for that to haue withdravvne my ſelfe, it would haue beene a paine to me, little leſſe than death.</p>

For my part (replyed <hi>Lindamor)</hi> I honour <hi>Galathee</hi> as my Lady; but I likevviſe loue her as a faire Lady: and me thinks, my fortune mayayme as high as it is permitted mine eyes to looke; and that I ſhall offend no diuinity by louing her. With ſuch like diſcourſes they parted, neyther of them well ſatisfied, yet ſome what differing, <hi>Polemas</hi> out of iclouſie, and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> for hauing found the vnfaithfulneſſe of his friend. From that day they liued in a pleaſant faſhion, for they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily together, and yet they concealed their deſſignes. Yet not <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> in apparance, but in effect, hid himſelfe in all hee propounded and purpoſed to do: and knowing well, that occaſions paſſed, may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, he would not loſe a moment of leiſure, which he employed not to make his affection apparent to the Nimph. In which hee neyther loſt his time, nor his payne; for ſhe liked ſo well of this good will, which hee made ſhew of, that if ſhee had not ſo much loue as he in her eyes, ſhe had it at the leaſt in her heart. And becauſe it is an hard matter to hide a great fire ſo well, but ſomething will diſcouer it: their affections which
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:177519:147"/>
beganne to burne in good earneſt, were hardly to be concealed for all the wiſedome they could vſe.</p>
                  <p>This was the cauſe that <hi>Galathee</hi> reſolued to ſpeake with <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as ſeldome as ſhe could, and to find ſome inuention for him to ſend his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to receiue their ſecrets; and for this purpoſe ſhee made a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeigne on <hi>Fleurial,</hi> nephevv to the Nurſe of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and brother of hers, whoſe good will ſhee had long knowne, for that being Gardiner of thoſe faire gardens of <hi>Monbriſon,</hi> as his father during his life had beene, when they carried <hi>Galathee</hi> abroad, he tooke her often in his armes, and went vp and downe, gathering what floures ſhee would; and you know that theſe loues of infancy, being as it were ſucked in with the milke, turne almoſt into nature: beſides that, ſhe knew well, that all countrey ſwaines are couetous; dealing bountifully with him, ſhee wonne him entirely to her. And it fell out as ſhe purpoſed, for one day being ſome diſtance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued from vs, ſhe called him to her, fayning to aske him the name of ſome flowres which ſhe held in her hand; and after ſhe had asked him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loude of them, ſomewhat abaſing her voyce, ſhe ſayd to him, Come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Fleurial,</hi> doſt thou loue me well? Madame (anſwered he) I ſhould be the verieſt wretch liuing, if I loued you not aboue all the world beſide. May I be aſſured (ſaid the Nymph) of what thou ſayeſt? May I (replyed he) neuer liue a moment, if I chooſe not rather to be wanting to heauen than to you. What, (anſwered <hi>Galathee)</hi> without any exception, were it in a thing that might diſpleaſe <hi>Amaſis</hi> or <hi>Clidamon?</hi> I care not then, ſayd <hi>Fleurial,</hi> whom I diſpleaſe in ſeruing you: for I am to none but to you: and whoſoeuer payes mee, yet it is of you that this benefit befalles mee, and when this ſhall ceaſe to be: I alwayes had ſuch an affection to you, that euer ſince your childhood, I gaue my ſelfe entirely to you. But, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, whereto ſerue theſe words? I ſhall neuer be ſo happy to be able to giue proofe of it.

At this word <hi>Galathee</hi> came to ſeeke vs out, and laughing, ſaid, That <hi>Fleurial</hi> and ſhe had talked a good while of Loue, but, ſaid ſhe, it was loue of the garden, for that is the loue of the ſimple. <hi>Fleurial,</hi> for his part, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hee had turned ſome turnes about the garden, went forth ſome what troubled with this affaire; for he was not ſo ignorant, but hee knew well the danger into which he put himſelfe: whether with <hi>Amaſis,</hi> if he ſhould diſcouer it, or with <hi>Galathee,</hi> if he ſhould not do as ſhe commanded him, thinking it was about loue: and hee had heard them ſay, that all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences of Loue ſtrike to the heart. At laſt, the amity he bare to <hi>Galathee,</hi> and the deſire of gaine, made him reſolue, ſince hee had promiſed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme his promiſe: and then he went to ſeeke out <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted him; for the Nymph had aſſured him that ſhee would ſend him, and that onely he ſhould direct him what he was to doe.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſaw him, he made ſhew before others, not to know the cauſe, &amp; asked him if he had any buſineſſe with him.

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, &amp; offered him his ſeruice at his pleaſure. <hi>Lindamor</hi> thanked him, &amp; hauing ſhortly inſtructed him what he was to doe, he iudged the thing ſo eaſie, that he made no difficulty: from that time (as I told you) when <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> would write, <hi>Fleurial</hi> made ſhew to preſent ſome ſuire to the Nymph, and when ſhe made anſwer, ſhee returned it backe with ſuch an order as ſhee could obtaine from <hi>Amaſis.</hi> And becauſe ordinarily, theſe olde ſeruants haue alwayes ſome thing or other to aske, this man neuer wanted matter to exhibit at all times of ſome new requeſt, which often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receiued an anſwer beyond his hopes.</p>
                  <p>Now during this time, the loue which the Nymph had borne to <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemas,</hi> leſſened in ſuch ſort, that hardly could ſhee ſpeake to him without diſgrace, which he could not beare: and knowing well, that all this cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe procceded of the loue of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he ſuffered himſelfe to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported ſo farre, that not daring to ſpeake againſt <hi>Galathee,</hi> hee could not abſtaine from ſpeaking many things to the diſaduantage of <hi>Lindamor:</hi> and among other, that though he were an honeſt man, and accompliſhed with many remarkable parts, yet the good opinion which he had of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, was not like theirs that know how to meaſure themſelues; and for proofe of it, he had beene ſo proud as to raiſe his eyes to the loue of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathee,</hi> and not onely to conceiue it in his ſoule, but to vaunt of it in ſpeech to him.

ſo farre paſſed, that almoſt all the Court knew it.

And why (ſayd ſhe) haue I not heard it ſayd, that loue, to make it praiſe worthy, muſt be vertuous? If this be ſo, he muſt bee tied to the lawes of vertue. Loue, anſwered I, is a thing ſome what greater then this vertue, of which you ſpeake, and therefore it giues it ſelfe lawes without the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of any other perſon: but ſince you command me to ſpeake frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tell me, Madam, are not you more culpable then hee, both in that for which you accuſe him, and in that which concernes loue? for if hee haue had the hardneſſe to ſay he loued you, you are the cauſe, in that you haue ſufferd him. Though it bee ſo, anſwered ſhee, yet by diſcretion he was bound to conceale it. Complaine you then (ſayd I) of his diſcretion, and not of his loue? But hee hath more occaſion to complaine of your loue, ſince vpon the firſt report at the firſt conceit that hath beene giuen you, you haue chaſed from you the loue you bare him, without taxing him that he hath bene wanting in affection.</p>
                  <p>Excuſe me, Madam, if I ſpeake ſo frankly: you do the greateſt wrong in the world to vſe him in this ſort: at leaſt if you would condemne him to ſo great a puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, it ought not to be without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uincing him, or at leaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to make him blufh at his errour.

                  <p>It was an effect of Loue which brought a change in the carriage of <hi>Galathee,</hi> for I ſawe her much mollified; but this was no ſmall proofe of her lofty humour, not to giue knowledge of it, and not beeing able to commaund her countenance, which was become pale, ſhee ſo tyed her tongue, that ſhe ſpake no word which might accuſe her of relenting; but going out of her chamber, to walke in the garden, not ſpeaking a word of the Letter: for the Sunne beganne to grow lowe, and her diſeaſe, which was but trauaile of ſpirit, might finde more refreſhing out of the houſe, than in the bed: ſo, after ſhe was quickely made ready, ſhee went downe into the garden, and would haue none but me with her.

                  <p>I ſent this Billet, as I told you, to deceiue <hi>Galathee,</hi> and indeed I repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me of it ſhortly after, as I will tell you. It was about a moneth after <hi>Fleurial</hi> was gone, when behold, there comes a knight, armed at all pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, an vnknowne Herald with him; and, to keepe all men from knovv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him he had his viſor downe. By his port, euery one iudged of him as hee was indeede. And becauſe at the towne-gate the Herald had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to be conducted to <hi>Amaſis,</hi> euery one, deſirous to heare ſome newes, accompanyed him. Being come vp to the Caſtle, the Guarde of the towne left him to them of the Gate-houſe. And after they had giuen notice to <hi>Amaſis,</hi> they were brought before her, who had ſent for <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> to giue audience to theſe ſtrangers. The Herald, after the Knight had kiſſed the robe of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> and the hand of her ſonne, ſayd thus with words halfe outlandiſh: Madam, this knight whom you ſee, being borne of the greateſt of his countrey, hauing knowne, that in your Court euery man of honour may demand reaſon of them that offend him, is come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this aſſurance, to caſt himſelfe at your feete, and to beſeech you, that Iuſtice which you neuer denyed to any, may be allowed him in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and before all theſe fayre Nymphs, to draw reaſon from him, who hath done him the iniury, by the meanes vſuall to perſons ſo wronged. <hi>Amaſis,</hi> after ſhe had ſome while thought with herſelfe, at laſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that it is true, that this ſort of deſence of honour had alwayes beene vſed in this Court: but ſhe, being a woman, did neuer ſuffer them to come in armes, yet her ſonne was of age to manage greater affaires than theſe, and ſhe would referre her ſelfe to that he ſhould do. <hi>Clidaman,</hi> without ſtaying for the Heralds replie, turning to <hi>Amaſis,</hi> ſaid: Madame, it is not onely to be ſerued and honored of all thoſe that inhabit this Prouince, wherein the gods haue eſtabliſhed you the Soueraigne Lady, and your Anceſtours alſo: but much rather to puniſh them that are faulty, and to
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:177519:152"/>
honour thoſe that deſerue well, the beſt meanes of all is, by Armes, at the leaſt, in thoſe things that cannot otherwiſe be ſearched out; ſo that if you aboliſh out of your eſtate this moſt iuſt faſhion of diſcouering the ſecret practices of the wicked, you giue way vnto licencious lewdneſſe, that will neuer feare to doe euill, ſo that it may be performed in ſecret. Beſide that, theſe ſtrangers being the firſt, that in your time haue had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to you, haue ſome reaſon to complayne, to be the firſt refuſed. So that ſince you haue referred them to me, I will tell you (ſayd he) turning him about towards the Herald, that this Knight may frankely and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly accuſe whomſoeuer he will, for I promiſe him to aſſure himſelfe of the field.</p>
                  <p>The Knight then ſet his knee to the ground, kiſſed his hand, by way of thankes, and made a ſigne to the Herald to hold on. Sir (ſayd he) ſince you doe him this grace, I muſt tell you, he is heere in ſearch for a Knight called <hi>Polemas,</hi> whom I deſire may be ſhewed me, that I may finiſh what I haue vndertaken. <hi>Polemas</hi> hearing himſelfe named, came forward, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a faſhion lofty enough, that he was the man whom he ſought for. Then the vnknowne Knight preſented to him a piece of armour; and the Herald ſayd: This Knight would ſay, that he preſents you this gage, promiſing that he will be tomorrow, by the Sunne riſing, at the place that ſhall be appointed, to fight with you, to the vttermoſt, to prooue on you, that you haue wickedly inuented that which you haue ſayd againſt him. Herald, I receiue (ſaid he) this gage; for though I know not thy Knight, yet wil I not leaue to be moſt aſlured to haue iuſtice on my ſide, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well, that I neuer ſayd any thing againſt the truth: and let the morrow be the day of triall. At this word the Knight, after he had ſaluted <hi>Amaſis</hi> and all the Ladies, returned into a Tent, which hee cauſed to be ſpred neere the towne-gate. You may thinke that this put all the Court in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diuers diſcourſes: eſpecially <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who loued <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> well, had much griefe to ſee him in this danger, yet their promiſe bound them to graunt the field. As for <hi>Polemas,</hi> he prepared himſelfe as full of courage to the combate, without hauing knowledge of his enemy. And for <hi>Galathee,</hi> that by this time had almoſt forgotten the offence that <hi>Lindamor</hi> had receiued from <hi>Polemas,</hi> (beſides that, ſhee beleeued not that he knew his euill came from thence) ſhe neuer thought of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> nor I neither, who tooke him to be an hundred leagues from vs, and yet it was he, who hauing receiued my Letter, reſolued to be reuenged in this ſort, and ſo vnknowne, came to preſent himſelfe, as I told you. But to make ſhort, for I am no great good warriour, and ſo I ſhould (if I

                  <p>After long combate, they had both of them equall aduantage, and they were both ſo loaden with blovves, that the ſoundeſt of the two was as much certaine of his death, as of his life, their horſes beganne to ſinke vnder them; but they on the contrary, ſo freſh, as if they had not fought all that day, beganne to powre out their bloud, and to open wide gaſhes, with ſuch cruel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Amaſis</hi> among others ſaid to <hi>Clidaman,</hi> that it were fit to ſeparate them: and there was none that might better doe it than <hi>Galathee.</hi> Shee that for her part was already touched within, and wayted but for this commandement, to effect it with a good heart, with three or foure of vs came into the field. When ſhe entred, the victory lay on <hi>Lindamors</hi> ſide, and <hi>Polemas</hi> was brought to euill termes, although the other were not much wounded, on whom, by chance, ſhe lighted, and taking him by the skarfe, which tied his helmet, and which hung ſomewhat lowe behinde him, ſhe pulled him with ſome ſtreſſe. He that felt himſelfe touched, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned rudely on that ſide, thinking he had bin betrayed, and with that furie, that the Nymph thinking to giue backe, leſt ſhe ſhould be hurt, trode on her robe, and fell dovvne in the midſt of the field. <hi>Lindamor,</hi> who knevv her, ranne preſently to helpe her vp; but <hi>Polemas,</hi> without any regard to the Nymph, ſeeing this aduantage, when he was in deſpaire of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, tooke his ſvvord in both his hands, and gaue him, behind on the head, tvvo or three blowes, with ſuch force, that he conſtrayned him with one great wound to ſet one knee on the ground, from whence he roſe ſo ince<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>So <hi>Lindamor</hi> departed, after he had kiſſed the hand of his miſtriſſe, who neuer knew him though he ſpake to her, for the Helmet, and the feare wherein ſhe was, kept her from marking his voyce. It is true, that paſſing by me, he ſaid very ſoftly, Faire <hi>Leonide,</hi> I am much bound vnto you, to conceale me to your ſelfe: thus you ſee the effect of your letters: &amp; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

longer ſtay, mounted on horſe backe, and though he were ſore woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, yet galloped he away, vntill they loſt the ſight of him, vnwilling to be knowne.</p>
                  <p>This trauell of his did him much hurt, and brought him to that extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that being arriued at the houſe of one of <hi>Fleurials</hi> Aunts, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued before to withdraw, if he were wounded, hee found himſelfe ſo feeble, that hee ſtayed more then three weekes before hee could recouer himſelfe. In the meane time, behold, <hi>Galathee</hi> returning in great choler againſt the vnknowne Knight, for that hee did not leaue the combate at the ſecond time, ſeeming to be more offended in this refuſall, then obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, in that he gaue him to her. And becauſe <hi>Polemas</hi> held one of the firſt rankes, as you know, <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> with much ſorrow, cauſed him to be carried out of the field, and looked vnto with ſuch care, that in the end they began to haue hope of life in him.</p>
                  <p>Euery one was very deſirous to know who this vnknowne Knight was, the courage and valor of whom, had won him the fauor of many. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathee</hi> onely was ſhe that conceiued an euill opinion; for this proud beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred the offence, but forgot the courteſie. And becauſe I was the party whom ſhe truſted with her moſt ſecret thoughts, as ſoon as ſhe ſaw me in priuate, Know you (ſaid ſhe) this diſcourteous Knight, to whom Fortune, not valour, gaue the aduantage in this fight? I know (ſaid I, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam) this valiant Knight, &amp; I know him to be as courtcous as valiant. He hath not ſhewed it (ſaid ſhe) in this action, otherwiſe he would not haue refuſed to leaue the combate when I requeſted him. Madame, anſwered I, you blame him for that, for which you are to eſteeme him, ſince that, to giue you the honor which euery one owes to you, he was in danger of his life, and ſaw his blood powre downe on the earth. If (ſaid <hi>Galathee)</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Polemas</hi> did wrong he had the aduantage ſhortly after, when notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding any prayer I could make, hee would not giue ouer. And had he not reaſon (ſaid I) to bee deſirous to chaſtiſe this pride, for the ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect hee bare to you? And for my part, I finde, that in this, <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> hath done very well. How, (interrupted ſhee) was it <hi>Lindamor</hi> that fought?

At this word ſhee pawſed out of extreme choler: And I, that in any caſe deſired ſhe ſhould know he had done no wrong, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Is it poſſible, Madame, that you can complaine of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out acknowledging the wrong you haue done to your ſelfe? What diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure hath he done you, ſince in vanquiſhing <hi>Polemas,</hi> hee hath vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>your enemy? How, my enemy (ſaid ſhe?) Ah! <hi>Lindamor</hi> is much more: for if <hi>Polemas</hi> talked, <hi>Lindamor</hi> gaue him the ſubiect. O God (ſayd I then) what is that I heare? <hi>Lindamor</hi> your enemy? that hath no ſoule but to adore you, and hath not a drop of blood which hee would not ſpend for your ſeruice: and he your friend, that by his forged diſcourſes, hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured by practices to wound your honour? But who knowes (ſaid ſhe) if it bee not true that <hi>Lindamor,</hi> thruſt forward by his vſuall arrogancy, hath vſed ſuch language? Well then, replyed I, how much are you bound to <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that hee hath made your enemy confeſſe that he inuented it? Oh! Madame, pardon mee, if you pleaſe: but I cannot but herein accuſe you of a great miſtaking, that I may not ſay ingratitude. If hee hazzard his life to make it appeare that <hi>Polemas</hi> lyed, do you accuſe him of incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration? And if he haue made the lyer confeſſe it, will you taxe him of diſcourteſie? And if hee had not committed his right to Armes, how ſhould the truth of this buſineſſe haue beene found?

O poore <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor,</hi> how muſt I bewaile thy fortune? And what is it thou canſt doe, when thy moſt notable ſeruices are offences and iniuries? But well, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, it may be, you ſhall not haue long time to vſe theſe cruelties: for a moſt pittifull death may bring end to your miſtakings and his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and (it may be) euen now, when I ſpeake, he is no more; and if it be ſo, the Nymph, <hi>Galathee,</hi> is the onely cauſe. Why doe you accuſe me, ſaid ſhe? Becauſe (replyed I) that when you would haue ſeparated them, and in recoyling, your knee touched the ground, hee would haue helped you vp: in the meane time that courteous <hi>Polemas,</hi> whom you commend ſo much, wounded him in two or three ſeuerall places, out of that aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, where I ſaw the blood make the ground red: but if hee dye for this, it is leſſe euill then that he receiues from you: for ſeeing himſelfe miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, hauing done his endeuour, this (me thinks) is a diſpleaſure to which no other can be equalled. But, Madame, may it pleaſe you to remember, that heretofore you haue ſayd to me, in complayning of him, that to blot out theſe ſpeeches of <hi>Polamas,</hi> he knew no other remedy; hee was to ſerue
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:177519:154"/>
himſelfe of ſword and blood. And now hee hath done that which you iudged he ſhould doe, and yet you finde it not well done.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Siluie,</hi> and ſome other Nymphs had not interrupted vs, before I had left off my diſcourſe, I had well aſwaged this great minde of the Nymph; but ſeeing ſo many perſons, we changed our talke. And yet my words were not without effect, though ſhee would make no ſhew of it to me, but by a thouſand paſſages I found the truth: for, from that day I reſolued neuer to ſpeake to her more of him, vnleſſe ſhe asked me ſome newes. She on the other ſide, looked that I ſhould ſpeake firſt, and ſo more then eight dayes paſſed without ſpeech. But in the meane time, <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damor</hi> was not without care to know both what was ſaid of him in Court, and what <hi>Galathee</hi> thought of him.

                  <p>I enquired particularly of <hi>Fleurial,</hi> how he fared, &amp; if there were any that knew him: and I vnderſtood that hee had loſt much blood, and that much hindred his healing: but there was no danger: that to bee knowne, it could not bee, becauſe the Herald was a Franke of the army of <hi>Meroue,</hi> who kept about the banks of <hi>Rhine</hi> at that time; and they that attended him, were not ſuffered to go out of doores, and that his Aunt and Siſter tooke him but for the knight that fought with <hi>Polemas,</hi> whoſe valour and liberality wonne them to ſerue him with that care, that they were not to doubt but he would be better; that hee had commanded him to come know of me, what the bruite was in the Court, and what he was to do. I anſwered him, that hee ſhould carry to <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that all the Court was full of his valour, though he were vnknowne, that for the reſt hee ſhould looke to his healing, and that I, for my part, would bring what I could
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:177519:155"/>
to his contentment. Thus, I gaue him mine anſwere, and told him the day before your departure, When <hi>Galathee</hi> comes into the garden, inuent ſome occaſion to go to ſee your Aunt, and take leaue of her, for it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for our buſines, that I ſpeake with you againe. He failed not, and by fortune the next day, the Nymph being come toward euening into the garden, <hi>Fleurial</hi> came to make his reuerence, and would ſpeake with her: but <hi>Galathee,</hi> that thought it was to giuer her letters from <hi>Lindamor,</hi> ſtood ſo confuſed, that I ſaw her change colour, and looked pale like death. And becauſe I feared, <hi>Fleurial</hi> would perceiue it, I came forward, &amp; ſaid to her, Madam, here is <hi>Fleurial,</hi> that would go to ſee his Aunt becauſe ſhe is ſicke, and deſires you to giue him leaue for ſome few dayes. <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee</hi> turning her eies and words to mee, asked what her diſeaſe was. I thinke (anſwered I) it is ſo many yeeres paſſed, that it takes from her all hope of recouery. Then ſhe turned to <hi>Fleurial,</hi> and ſayd, Go and returne quickly, but not before ſhe be well if it be poſſible: for I loue her well, for the ſpeciall good will, which ſhee hath alwayes borne mee. At this word ſhe held on her walking, and I ſet my ſelfe to ſpeake to him, and ſhewed in my geſture more then indeed of diſpleaſure, and admiration, that the Nimph might note it: at laſt I told him, See, <hi>Fleurial,</hi> you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

After he had promiſed me, he went his way, and I diſpoſed my countenance the beſt I could to ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and diſpleaſure; and ſometimes when I was in place where the Nymph only might he are, I fained to ſigh, and lift vp mine eies to heauen, and ſtrike my hands together, and to be ſhort, I did al I could imagine to giue her ſome ſuſpition of what I would. She, as I told you, that looked alwayes when I ſhould ſpeake of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> ſeeing I ſayd nothing, but on the contrary auoided all occaſions, and in ſtead of that pleaſant humor, which made mee bee eſteemed of among my companions, I had but a troubled melancholy, by little and little began to bee of opinion, that I would giue it her, but not all: for my purpoſe was to make her beleeue, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> going from the combat, was ſo ſore wounded, that he was dead, that pity might obtaine that of that glorious ſoule, which neither affection nor ſeruices could. Now, as I told you, my plot was ſo well fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it fell out as I did fore caſt, for though ſhe would diſſemble, yet could ſhe not chooſe but be as liuely touched for <hi>Lindamor,</hi> as any might be. And ſo ſeeing me ſad, and mure, ſhe imagined either he was in very hard caſe, or ſome thing worſe, and felt her ſelfe ſo preſſed with this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, that ſhe could not poſſibly longer hold out her reſolution.</p>

Two daies after, that <hi>Fleurial</hi> was gone, ſhe made me come into her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binet, and ſeeming to talk of another matter, ſayd to me, Know you how <hi>Fleurials</hi> Aunt doth? I anſwered, that ſince he went I knew nothing. Truely (ſayd ſhe) I would be very ſorry, if the old woman ſhould not do well: you haue reaſon (ſayd I) Madam, for ſhe loues you, and you haue had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeruices of her, which are not yet fully acknowledged. If ſhe liue (ſaid ſhe) I will do it, and after her, I will remember <hi>Fleurial</hi> for her ſake. Then I anſwered, Both the ſeruices of the aunt, &amp; thoſe of the Nephew, deſerue ſome good recompence, and eſpecially <hi>Fleurial;</hi> for his faithfulneſſe, and affection cannot be bought. It is true (ſayd ſhe) but becauſe you ſpeake of <hi>Fleurial,</hi> what great matter had you to ſay to him? or hee to you, when he went away? I anſwered coldly, I recommended mee to his aunt. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations (ſayd ſhe) were not ſo long: then ſhe came neerer me and layd her hand on my ſhoulder: Tell truth, continued ſhee; you ſpake of ſome other thing. And what might it bee (replied I) if it were not that? I had no other buſineſſe with him. Now I know (ſayd ſhe) that at this preſent you diſſemble: why did you ſay you had no other buſineſſe with him, and haue had ſo much for <hi>Lindamor?</hi> O! Madam, I little thought you would haue remembred a man ſo vnfortunate; and then holding my peace, I fetched a deepe ſigh. What is the matter (ſayd ſhe) that you ſigh? tell me true; where is <hi>Lindamor? Lindamor</hi> (anſwered I) is no more then earth. How, (cried ſhee out) <hi>Lindamor</hi> is no more? No indeed (anſwered I) the cruelty which you haue vſed towards him, hath rather ſlaine him then the ſtrokes of his enemy: for going from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and knowing by the report of many, the euill ſatiſfaction which you had of him, he would neuer ſuffer himſelfe to be dreſſed; and becauſe you haue ſuch a deſire to know, that was it that <hi>Fleurial</hi> told mee, whom I commanded to aſſay, if he could wiſely withdraw the letters which wee haue writ him, to the end that as you haue loſt the remembrance of his ſeruices by your cruelty, ſo might I conſume in the fire the memories which might remaine. O God (ſayd ſhe) what is that you tell me? Is it poſſible he ſhould be ſo loſt? It is you (ſayd I) that may ſay you haue loſt him: for his part, hee hath gained by dying, ſince by death hee hath found reſt, which your cruelty will neuer permit him, while hee liued.</p>
                  <p>Ah! <hi>Leonide</hi> (ſayd ſhe) you tell me theſe things, to put mee to paine: confeſſe the truth, hee is not dead. Would to God it were ſo (ſayd I) but for what cauſe ſhould I tell you? I anſwere, his death or life are indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to you; and ſpecially ſince you loued him ſo little, you may be glad to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:177519:156"/>
be exempted for the importunity he would haue giuen you: for you are to beleeue that if he had liued, hee would neuer haue ceaſed from giuing ſuch proofes of his affection, as that of <hi>Polemas.</hi> Indeed then, ſayd the Nymph, I am ſorry for the poore <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and ſweare vnto you, that his death touches me more to the quicke, then I though it would: but tell me, had he neuer no remembrance of vs at his end? and did hee not ſhew to be grieued to leaue vs? See, Madam (ſayd I) a queſtion which is not vſuall! He died for your ſake, and you aske if hee remembred you? Ah! that his memory and his ſorrow had not bin too great for his helth! I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you talke no more of him. I aſſure my ſelfe, he is in the place where he receiues the reward of his fidelity, and where it may bee, hee ſhall ſee himſelfe reuenged at you coſt. You are in choler (ſayd ſhe.) You muſt pardon me (ſayd I) Madam: but this is the reaſon that conſtraines me to ſpeake thus, for there is none that can giue more teſtimony of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fidelity then I, and of the wrong you haue done him, to giue him ſo vnworthy a recompence for ſo many ſeruices. But (ſayd the Nymph) let vs ſet this aſide; for I know that in ſome thing you haue reaſon: but I haue not done ſo much wrong as you impute. And tell mee, I pray you, by the loue you beare me, if in his laſt words hee remembred mee, and what they were? Muſt you (ſayd I) triumph in your ſoule at the end of his life, as you haue done ouer al his actions, ſince he bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to loue you? If this muſt be to your contentment, I will ſatiſfie you. As ſoone as he knew that you went about to blemiſh the honor of his victory, and that in ſtead of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing you, he hath by this fight got your hatred, it ſhal neuer be (ſayd he) O iniuſtice, that thou ſhalt, for my cauſe, lodge longer in ſo faire a ſoule. I muſt by my death waſh away my offence. Then hee tooke all the clouts which hee had on his wounds, and would no more ſuffer the hand of the Chirurgion: his wounds were not mortall, but the ranckling brought it to thoſe termes, that he perceiued ſmall ſtrength in him to liue: he called <hi>Fleurial,</hi> and being alone, hee ſayd, My friend <hi>Fleurial,</hi> thou now lofeſt him that had great care to do thee good: but you muſt arme your ſelfe with patience, ſince it is the will of heauen: I would yet haue one piece of ſeruice from thee, which ſhall better pleaſe me, then that thou euer didſt, And hauing drawne from him a promiſe that hee would do it: hee conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, You muſt not faile in what I bid you. As ſoone as I ſhall be dead, rip vp my belly, and take out the heart, and carry it to the faire <hi>Galathee,</hi> and tell her that I ſend it her, that at my death I may keepe nothing that belongs to any other. At theſe laſt words, hee loſt both ſpeech and life.</p>

Now this foole <hi>Fleurial,</hi> that hee may not bee wanting in that which was commanded him, by a perſon whom he held ſo deare, hath brought hither the heart, and without me would preſent it to you. Ah! <hi>Leonide,</hi> (ſayd ſhe) is it certaine he is dead? Oh God, that I knew not his ſicknes! and you would neuer tell me of it! I would haue found ſome remedy. O what a loſs haue I ſuſtained! &amp; how great is your fault! Madam, (anſwerd I) I knew nothing: for <hi>Fleurial</hi> ſtayed with him to attend him, becauſe he had none of his owne: but if I had knowne, I thinke I ſhould not haue ſpoken to you of it, I knew your mind was ſo far remoued from that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. At theſe words, reſting her head on her arme, ſhe commanded me to leaue her alone, to the end, as I thought, that I might not ſee her teares which already encreaſed their drops: but hardly was I gone, before ſhee called me backe, and without lifting vp her head, ſhee bid mee command <hi>Fleurial</hi> to bring her that which <hi>Lindamor</hi> had ſent her, in what faſhion he liſted. And preſently I went out, fully aſſured that the knights affaires for whom I pleaded, would fall out as I had propounded. In the meane time, when <hi>Fleurial</hi> returned to <hi>Lindamor,</hi> he found him in paine, for the long tarrying hee made at <hi>Mont-briſon:</hi> but my letter reioyced him ſo, that at an inſtant a man might ſee him amended.

Now, that which I anſwered (that I may not trouble you with ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny letters) was in ſum, that as ſoone as he might endure trauell, he ſhould finde meanes to ſpeake with mee, that then hee ſhould know how true I was; and as ſhortly as I could, I let him know all the talke that <hi>Galat hee</hi> and I had, and the diſpleaſure ſhe had of his death, and the will ſhe had to haue his heart. See what the force is of a ſtrong affection! <hi>Lindamor</hi> had beene wounded in many places, and loſt ſo much bloud, that he was in danger of his life; yet beyond the hope of the Surgeous, as ſoone as he receiued the laſt letter, you might ſee him walke, you might ſee him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrel himſelfe, and within two or three dayes after, he aſſayed to mount on horſe-backe; at laſt, he hazarded himſelfe to come to me: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he durſt not come by day, that hee might not be ſeene, hee clad himſelfe like a Gardner, and calling himſelfe the couſin of <hi>Fleurial,</hi> reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to come into the garden, and to behaue himſelfe as occaſion ſhould be offered.</p>
                  <p>As he ſet downe, ſo he put it to effect; and cauſing his clothes priuily to be made ready, he told the Aunt of <hi>Fleurial,</hi> that before the combate, he had made a vow, and that hee would render it before hee went out of thoſe parts: but that fearing the friends of <hi>Polemas,</hi> he would go in that diſguiſe, and deſired her to ſay nothing. The good old woman would haue diſſwaded him from the danger wherein he was, counſelling him, to put off his iourney, till ſome other time. But he that was carried with too ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a deuotion to break off, told her, that if he did it not before he went out of the country, hee beleeued, all the misfortunes of the world would befall him. So about euening he departed, that he might meete no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and arriued ſo happily, that vnſeene, he entred into the garden, and was led by <hi>Fleurial</hi> into the houſe, where (at that time) hee had but one ſeruant to helpe him to worke, whom he made beleeue, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was his couſin, whom he would teach the myſtery of a Gardner.

                  <p>So it was, that the morning was no ſooner come, but <hi>Lindamor,</hi> with a ſpade in his hand, enters the Garden. I would you had ſeene him with this toole: you might well know he was not vſed to it, and that he knew better to carry a launce. He hath ſworne to me an hundred times ſince, that he was neuer more aſhamed in his life, than to preſent himſelfe thus attired before the eyes of his miſtris; and he was twice or thrice in mind to returne.

As ſoone as ſhe ſawe <hi>Fleurial,</hi> ſhe was glad, and preſently made a ſigne with her eye: but though I aſſayed to ſpeake to him, yet could I not do it, becauſe the new Gardner was by, who was ſo changed in his habit, that none could know him. For my part I excuſe my ſelfe for not knowing him. For I would neuer haue thought that he would haue done this define, without acquainting me with it. But he hath ſince told mee, that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed it from me, knowing well, that I would neuer haue ſuffered him to come thither, in that ſort. Thinking then of any other rather than of him, I was very curious to aske of <hi>Fleurial,</hi> who this ſtranger was?

This gaue mee ſome commodity to ſpeake to <hi>Fleurial.</hi> But my companions, to paſſe the time, placed themſelues about <hi>Lindamor;</hi> and euery one to make him ſpeake, ſaid ſomewhat: and he anſwered them all, but with things ſo farre from the purpoſe, that they could not chooſe but laugh; for he ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

In the meane time, going to <hi>Fleurial,</hi> I asked him how <hi>Lindamor</hi> did? He anſwered, he was yet ill enough: <hi>Lindamor</hi> had willed him to ſay ſo. And whence comes his euill (ſaid I) for you told me his wounds were almoſt healed? You may know, anſwered he, by the Letter hee hath written to my Lady. My Lady (ſaid I) thinkes hee is dead; but giue it me, and I will let her ſee it, fayning that it was long ſince written. I dare not (anſwered he) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

he hath expreſly forbidden mee, and hath tied mee by oath. How (ſaid I) is <hi>Lindamor</hi> entred into miſtruſt of me? Not ſo, ſaid he, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily hee prayes you make the Nymph beleeue hee is dead. But for his good, and my aduantage, the Nymph muſt receiue the letter at my hands. I was put into choller, and had ſaid more, if I had not feared to be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. But hee did ſo well that hee was commaunded, that I could draw no other thing from him; but for concluſion, that if the Nymph would haue that which <hi>Lindamor</hi> gaue her, ſhe muſt receiue it at his hands. And when I told him, that it might be long before hee could ſpeake with her, and that may doe hurt: he anſwered me not, but with nodding his head: by which he let me know he would not do it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Galathee</hi> perceiuing that we talked, deſirous to know the ſubiect, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from her walke ſooner than of cuſtome; and hauing called mee, would know what it was. I ſayd to her freely, I would tell her that which was the reſolution of <hi>Fleurial,</hi> but in ſtead of the Letter, I ſaid it was the heart of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and that hauing beene in any caſe commaunded by him at his death, hee thought hee ſhould commit treaſon, if hee did not performe his promiſe. Then <hi>Galathee</hi> anſwered me, that ſhee meant to ſpeake with him particularly, and that ſhe thought hee could not haue a ſitter meane than to fayne the bringing of ſome fruite in a basket, and in the bottome they might lay the heart. I anſwered, This might well be ſo done: but I knew him to be ſuch a beaſt, that he would doe nothing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Auarice gaue him hope to haue much from her, if himſelfe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented (in deliuering the heart into her hands) the ſeruices which in theſe occaſions he had done. O (ſaid ſhe) if he keepe it but for this, let him tell you what he will haue onely: for I will giue it him. That ſhall be (re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I) a kinde of ranſome which you muſt pay for that heart. That is not (ſayd ſhe) of money that I muſt pay, but of my teares, and thoſe drawne from my bloud. It may be, ſhe was ſorry ſhe ſaid ſo much. So it was, that ſhe commanded mee in the morning to ſpeake to <hi>Fleurial:</hi> which I did, and ſet before him all that which I thought might moue him to giue me this Letter, euen to threatning. But all vvas in vaine: for, for reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he ſaid, Looke, <hi>Leonide,</hi> till the heauen and earth meet together, I will doe no otherwiſe. If my Lady will know what I haue to ſay to her, the euenings are ſo bright, that ſhe may come with you to the foot of the ſtaires, which deſcend from her chamber: the Moone ſhines, I haue ſeene her come often, the way is not long, no body ſhall know of it: I aſſure my ſelfe, that when ſhe hath heard me, ſhe will not complaine of the labour ſhe hath taken.</p>

When he had ſaid thus, I was in extreme choler with him, repreſenting to him that he was to obey <hi>Galathee,</hi> and not <hi>Lindamor:</hi> that ſhe was his miſtris, that ſhe could do him good or ill. Shortly, that there was no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood that ſhee would take the paine. But he, without being mooued, told me, Nymph, it is not to <hi>Lindamor</hi> that I obey, but the oath which I haue made to the gods; if ſhe cannot in this ſort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

O God! what was the contentment of the new Gardner? He hath told me ſince, that in his life he neuer had ſuch a ſurfet of ioy: becauſe he perceiued his deuice beganne to take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

                  <p>But when <hi>Fleurial</hi> aduertiſed him of the reſolution ſhe had taken, this was a new reſurrection of Loue, at leaſt, if one may die for ſorrow, and reuiue by contentment.

                  <p>The Nymph to all theſe words made no anſwer, but Ah, <hi>Leonide,</hi> haue you betrayed me? and with theſe words went out into the Alley, where ſhe found a ſeat ſit for the purpoſe; for ſhe was ſo beſides her ſelf, that ſhe knew not where ſhe was.

                  <p>It would be too long, to tell you all the diſcourſe wee had. So it was, that at laſt we made a peace, and ſo, that this loue was more ſtrongly tied then euer before: yet with condition, that, for that preſent he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, to go whither <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clidaman</hi> had ſent him. This departure was vnpleaſing; yet hee muſt obey: and ſo, after hee had kiſſed <hi>Galath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

But to what purpoſe ſhould I particularize euery thing? <hi>Lindamor</hi> returned to them that being his followers expected him, &amp; from thence, with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>gence went where <hi>Clidaman</hi> thought hee was, and by the way hee framed a thouſand wiſe excuſes of his ſtay, ſometimes accuſing the incommodities of the mountaines, and ſometimes the ſicknes which yet appeared in his face, by reaſon of his wounds, and thinking that all
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:177519:160"/>
the while he was abſent from from his Lady, his buſineſſe was not worth the ſtay, he came backe with the permiſſion of <hi>Amaſis</hi> and <hi>Clidaman,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Forreſts,</hi> where being arriued, and hauing giuen a good account of his charge, he was honored and made much of, as his vertue deſerued. But all this went not to his heart, in reſpect of that aſpect, which he had from the Nymph, who ſince his laſt departure encreaſed ſo her good will, that I know not if <hi>Lindamor</hi> had cauſe to call himſelfe more louing, then belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.</p>
                  <p>This ſuite paſſed ſo farre, that one night being in the garden, he preſſed her oftentimes to permit him to demand her of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> that he was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine he had done ſuch ſeruices to her and her ſonne, that they would not deny him this grace. She anſwered, You may more doubt of their good will then of your deſerts; &amp; you may be leſſe aſſured of your merits, then of my good will: but I would not that you ſhould ſpeake of it, vntill <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman</hi> be married. I am yonger then he, I may ſtay ſo long. You may well (anſwered he) but ſo wil not the violence of my paſſion at leaſt, if you will not agree to this remedy, giue mee one that cannot hurt you, if your will be as you tell me. If I may (ſayd ſhe) without offending my ſelfe, I will promiſe you. After he had kiſſed her hand, Madam (ſayd hee) you haue promiſed me to ſweare before <hi>Leonide,</hi> and the gods, that heare our diſcourſe, that you will be my wife, as I take an oth before them; neuer to haue any other. <hi>Galathee,</hi> was ouertaken: yet fayning, that it was partly for the oth ſhe had taken, and partly by my perſwaſion, though indeed it were her owne affection, ſhe was contented, and ſwearing betweene my hands, with condition, that <hi>Lindamor</hi> ſhould neuer come into that garden, vntil the marriage were declared; and that to preuent the occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that may make them paſſe further; behold, <hi>Lindamor,</hi> the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that euer was, full of al ſorces of hope, at leaſt, of all thoſe that a louer might haue, that was beloued, and wayting but for the promiſed conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his deſires, when Loue, or rather Fortune would mocke him, and giue him the moſt cruell diſpleaſure that any might haue. O <hi>Lindamor,</hi> how vayne are theſe thy propoſitions?</p>
                  <p>At this time <hi>Clidaman</hi> being departed with <hi>Guymantes,</hi> to ſeeke the aduentures of armes, and then hee went to the army of <hi>Merone,</hi> and though hee went priuately, yet his actions made him well enough knowne; and becauſe <hi>Amaſis</hi> would not haue him ſtay there in that ſort, ſhe leuied all the forces ſhe could make, to ſend to him, and as you know, gaue the charge to <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and kept <hi>Polemas</hi> for gouerner vnder her of all her prouinces, vntill the comming of her ſonne: which ſhe did, as well
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:177519:160"/>
to giue ſatiſſaction to theſe two great perſonage<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, as to ſeparate them a little: for euer ſince the returne of <hi>Lindamer,</hi> they haue had ſome brabble together, were it, for that there is nothing ſo ſecret, which in ſome ſort is not diſcouered; and for that <hi>Polemas</hi> had ſome coniecture, that it was hee againſt whom he fought, or that loue only was the cauſe: ſo it was, that all men knew how little good will, they bare each to other. Now <hi>Polemas</hi> was wel content, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> went away with no ill wil; the one, that he might be neere his Miſtriſſe, the other, that hauing occaſion to do ſeruice to <hi>Amaſis,</hi> he might thereby binde her, hoping by this way to make eaſie the paſſage to that good which hee aſpired. But <hi>Polemas,</hi> that knew by the eye, how much hee was out of fauour, and contrarily, how many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uours his riuall had receiued, hauing now no hope, neither in his ſeruices not in his merits, ran to ſubtilty. And behold how he ſets vp a man! but the moſt crafty and deceitful that euer was in his miſtery, whom, without acquainting any in the Court, he cauſed ſecretly to ſee <hi>Amaſis, Galathee, Siluie, Silere,</hi> me and all the other Nymphs, and not only ſhewed him their face, but told him what he knew of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, namely the things moſt ſecret, whereof being an old Courtier, hee was well informed, and after deſired him to faine himſelfe to be a Druid or great diuine. Hee came into that great wood of <hi>Sauigneu</hi> neere the faire gardens of <hi>Mont-briſon,</hi> where by aſmall riuer, where he might paſſe ouer, he made his lodging, and tarried there ſome while, ſeeming to be a great diuiner; ſo that the bruite of him came to vs, and ſpecially <hi>Galathee</hi> went to him to know her fortune. This crafty companion could ſo well play his part, with ſuch circumſtances and ceremonies, that I muſt confeſſe the truth, I was deceiued as well as others.</p>
                  <p>So it was, that the concluſion of his cunning, was, to tell her that the heauens had giuen her by influence, the choice of a great good, or a great euill, and it was wiſedome to chooſe: That both the one and the other, was to proceed from that which ſhee ſhould loue; and if ſhe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected his aduice, ſhe ſhould be the vnhappieſt woman in the world: and contrarily, moſt happy, if ſhe made a good election; that if ſhe would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him, he would giue her ſo certaine knowledge both of the one and the other, that ſhe had no more to do, but to diſcerne them. And looking in her hand, and after on her face, hee ſayd, Such a day being within <hi>Marſellis,</hi> you ſhall ſee a man clad in ſuch a colour: if you marry him, you are the moſt miſerable in the world. Then hee let her ſee in a mirrour, a place which is by the riuer of <hi>Lignon,</hi> &amp; ſaid, You ſee this place, go at ſuch an houre, you ſhall finde the man that ſhall make you moſt happy, if you
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:177519:161"/>
marry him. Now <hi>Climanthe</hi> (ſo is this deceiuer called) had eunningly knowne both the day that <hi>Lindamor</hi> was to depart, and the colour of his cloaths: and his deſſine was, that <hi>Polemas</hi> ſeeming to go hunt, ſhould be at the place which he ſhewed in the glaſſe. Now heare, I pray you, how all fell out: <hi>Lindamor</hi> failed not to come forth apparelled as <hi>Climanthe</hi> had foretold, and that day <hi>Galathee,</hi> who had good remembrance of <hi>Linda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor,</hi> ſtood ſo aſtonied, that ſhe could not anſwere to what hee ſayd. The poore knight thought it was for the griefe of his departure ſo farre off: ſo that after he had kiſſed her hand, hee went away to the Army more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented than his fortune required. If I had knowne ſhe had beene of that opinion, I would haue endeuoured to haue diuerred her from it, but ſhee kept it ſo ſecret from me, that as then I had no knowledge of it. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the day drew on that <hi>Climanthe</hi> had told her, that ſhe ſhould finde about the <hi>Lignon,</hi> him that ſhould make her happy. Shee would not tell mee all her deſſigne, onely ſhee let me vnderſtand, if the Druyde were true in that which he ſaid: that the Court was ſo empty, that there was no pleaſure in it: that for a while Solitarineſſe would be more pleaſing: that ſhe was reſolued to goe to her Palace of <hi>Iſour,</hi> as priuately as ſhee could poſſibly: and that of her Nymphs ſhe would haue but <hi>Siluie</hi> and me, her Nurce and the little <hi>Merill.</hi> As for me that was cloyed with the Court, I ſayd, that it would be fit to withdraw a while: and ſo letting <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſis</hi> know, that ſhe would take phyſicke, ſhee might be gone the next morning.</p>
                  <p>But it was her Nurce that confirmed her in that opinion: for this good old woman that loued her Nurce-child very tenderly, eaſily being drawne to credite theſe predictions, as (for the moſt part) all of her age are, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled her to it, and preſſed her ſo that finding her already ſo inclined, It was an eaſie thing to thruſt her into this Labyrinth. For my part, I was neuer more aſtonied: for ſuppoſe there be but three perſons in this great building. But the Nymph, which well marked the day that <hi>Climanthe</hi> had ſet, prepared the euening before to goe thither, and in the morning dreſſed her ſelfe, the moſt to her aduantage ſhe could, and commaunded vs to doe the like. In that ſort we went in a Coach to the place aſſigned: where being arriued, by chance, at the houre which <hi>Climanthe</hi> had ſayd, we found a ſhepheard almoſt drowned, and halfe couered with mud and grauell, whom the fury of the water had caſt on our ſhore. This ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard was <hi>Celadon:</hi> I know not if you know him, who, by chance, being faine into <hi>Lignon,</hi> wanted of drowning himſelfe: but wee came ſo fitly, that wee ſaued him: for <hi>Galathee</hi> be leeuing it was hee that was to make

                  <p>But after hee came to himſelfe, and that his face was without ſoile, he ſeemed the goodlieft man that I can tell of; beſides that, he had a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſauoring of any thing, rather than of a ſhepheard.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus, all theſe things gaue no ſmall blowe to <hi>Lindamor,</hi> becauſe the Nymph, hauing found that true which this lyer told her, is reſolued to die, rather than to marry <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and ſtudies by all her skill to make her ſelfe amiable to this ſhepheard, who doth nothing, eſpecially in her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, but ſigh his abſence from <hi>Astrea.</hi> I know not whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint he is in, (for ſhe will not let him goe from the Palace) or whether the water which he ſwallowed, when he fell into the riuer, be the cauſe: ſo it is, that euer ſince he goes puling, ſometimes in bed, ſometimes out, but at laſt, he hath gotten a feuer ſo burning, that knowing no remedy for his health, the Nymph hath commaunded mee to ſeeke you out dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently, that you may ſee what is neceſſary to ſaue him aliue.</p>
                  <p>The Druyde was very attentiue during this diſcourſe, and gaue di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers iudgements, according to the ſubiect of his Nieces words, and (it may be) neere the truth: for he knew well, that ſhee was not altogether exempted, neither from Loue nor fault; yet as well aduiſed as he was, hee diſſembled it, and ſayd to his Niece, that it was no hard matter to ſerue <hi>Galathee,</hi> eſpecially in the perſon of <hi>Celadon,</hi> whoſe parents he had alwaies loued, and though he were a ſhepheard, yet deſcended he from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lyne of Knights; and that his Anceſtors had choſen that kinde of life, for the more quiet and happier then that at Court, and therefore he was to be honoured and well ſerued. But this faſhion of life which <hi>Galathee</hi> vſed, was neither good for the Nymph, nor honorable for her, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the Palace, and hauing ſeene the manner of things, he would tell her how ſhe ſhould gouerne her ſelfe. The Nymph, ſome what aſhamed, anſwered, It was ſome long time ſince ſhe had a purpoſe to tell him, but
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:177519:162"/>
ſhe neither durſt, not met with opportunity: for indeede, <hi>Climanthe</hi> was the cauſe of all the euill.

That will be eaſie (ſaid the Nymph) by a meane that I will tell you. He told <hi>Galathee</hi> that ſhe ſhould returne twice or thrice, to the place where ſhe was to finde this man, if ſhe found him not the firſt time: I know that <hi>Polemas</hi> and he hauing bin ſo tardy the firſt day, will not faile to come the others following: he that will take this deceiuer, he need but hide him in the place which I will ſhew you, whither, without doubt, he will come: and for the day, you may know it of <hi>Galathee;</hi> for, for my part, I haue forgotten it.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Ith this diſcourſe the Nymph deceiued, in part, the length of the way, both of them being ſo attentiue, that, almoſt before they were aware, they found they were neere the Palace of <hi>Iſour.</hi> But <hi>Adamas,</hi> that deſired in any wiſe to remedy this life, inſtructed her what he would haue her ſay to <hi>Galathee;</hi> and aboue al, not to let her know that he diſliked her actions: for (ſaid he) I know wel, that the courage of the Nymph muſt be ouercom with gentleneſſe, and not with force. But in the meane time (my Neece) remember you to doe your duty; that theſe allurements are ſhamefull, both to thoſe that are attained with them, and to them that fauour them.</p>
               <p>He had gone on with his aduices, if at the entry of the Palace they had not met <hi>Siluie,</hi> who led them to the place where <hi>Galathee</hi> was. At that time ſhe was gone to walke into the next Garden, while <hi>Celadon</hi> reſted. As ſoone as ſhe ſaw them, ſhe came towards them, and the Druyde, with one knee on the ground, ſaluted her, kiſſing her robe, and ſo did <hi>Leonide;</hi> but lifting them vp, ſhe embraced them both, thanking <hi>Adamas</hi> for the paines he had taken in comming, with aſſurance that ſhee would requite it in thoſe occaſions which might turne to his pleaſure. Madame, ſayd hee, all my ſeruices cannot deſerue the leaſt of theſe good words: I am onely ſorry, that that which is preſented, is not a ſtronger proofe of my affection; to the end, that in any caſe you might know, that if I be grown old without doing you ſeruice, it is not for want of good will, but for that I haue not had the happineſſe to be employed. <hi>Adamas</hi> (anſwered the Nymph) the ſeruices which you haue done to <hi>Amaſis,</hi> I take for mine; &amp; thoſe which I haue had from your Neece, I take them as from you; ſo that
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:177519:163"/>
you cannot ſay, but in the perſon of my mother, you haue well ſerued me; and in that of your Neece, you haue beene often imployed. Alwayes as I may, I will acknowledge your ſeruices together. But in that which is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered at this time, bethinke your ſelfe; that ſince there is nothing more grieuous then the ſtrokes that are layd on the part moſt ſenſible, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing my ſpirit wounded, you cannot finde the meanes to doe me more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſeruice then in this. We will talke of it at leaſure, in the meane time, goe to your reſt, and <hi>Siluie</hi> ſhall bring you to your chamber, and <hi>Leonide</hi> render account to me of what ſhe hath done.</p>
               <p>So the Druide went away: And <hi>Galathee</hi> vſing <hi>Leonide</hi> more kindly then of wont, demanded the newes of her voyage, wherein in ſhee ſatified her willingly: But (going forward) Madame (ſayd ſhe) I thanke God, I finde you more ioyfull then I left you.

O God, ſayd the Nymph, is it poſſible? I am aſſured, that if hee will vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, it cannot but all turne to my contentment: for his wiſedome is ſo great, and his iudgement alſo, that he cannot chooſe but bring about whatſoeuer he beginnes.

You muſt then vnderſtand, that it is long time ſince the beauty and merits of <hi>Leonide</hi> wanne her, after long ſuite, the affection of <hi>Polemas:</hi> and becauſe the deſerts of that knight were not ſo ſlender, but they could procure themſelues to be beloued: Your Neece was not contented to be beloued, but ſhe would alſo loue; but ſhe carried it with ſuch diſcretion, that euen <hi>Polemas</hi> was long with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the knowledge of it. I doubt not but you haue loued, and that you know better than I, how hardly Loue will be hidden: ſo it was, that at laſt it burſt out, and both knew they were louers, and beloued: yet was this amity ſo honeſt, that it would not ſuffer them to dare to ſhew it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſacrifice that <hi>Amaſis</hi> made euery yeere, on the day that ſhe marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Pimander,</hi> it fell out, that after dinner wee were all in the Gardens of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

We were ſcarcely there, but <hi>Polemas</hi> came to ſit by vs, ſeeming that it was by chance he met vs; but I obſerued, that he had ſome good while followed vs with his eye. And becauſe we ſate without any words, and that he had a good voyce, I ſayd to him, that hee ſhould binde vs much to him, if he would ſing. I will (ſaid he) if that fayre will commaund me, poynting to <hi>Leonide.</hi> Such a commaundement (ſaid ſhe) would be a great indiſcretion; but I will make vſe of my prayer, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if you haue any new thing.

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:177519:164"/>
a wager (ſaid ſhe) that I can diuine for whom this Song was made: and then drawing neere his eare, made as if ſhe named ſome; but indeed ſhe bade him take heede what he ſayd before me. He being diſcreete, drew backe, and anſwered; You haue not diuined right: I ſweare vnto you, it is not for her whom you named. Then I perceiued ſhe would hide her ſelfe from me, which was the cauſe, that fayning to gather ſome floures, I went from them on the other ſide, yet not without hauing an eye to their actions. Now <hi>Polemas</hi> himſelfe ſince hath told me all, but it was after his affection was paſſed ouer; for ſo long as that laſted, it was not in my power to make him confeſſe any thing. Being then alone, they took vp againe the diſcourſe which they had left, and ſhe was the firſt that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne.</p>
                  <p>And why <hi>Polemas</hi> (ſayd ſhee) doe you ieſt thus with your friends? Confeſſe the truth, for whom are theſe verſes? Faire Nymph (ſayd he) in your ſoule you know for whom they are as well as I. How! (ſayd ſhee) doe you beleeue me to be a diuiner? Yes certainely (anſwered <hi>Polemas)</hi> and of thoſe that obey not the gods, who ſpeak by their mouth, but make themſelues obeyed of him. What meane you by that enigmaticall ſpeech (ſayd the Nymph?) I meane, ſayd he, that Loue ſpeakes by your mouth, otherwiſe your words would not be ſo full of fire and loue, that they can kindle in all that behold them, ſo burning coles, and yet you obey him not, though he commaund, that he who loueth, ſhould be beloued: for diſobedient, you worke that they who die of loue for you, may well feele you faire, but neuer louing, nor ſo much as onely pitifull. I ſpeake for mine owne particular, that may ſweare with truth, that in the world there was neuer beauty better beloued than yours of me. In ſaying theſe laſt words, he bluſhed, and ſhe ſmiled, anſwering him, <hi>Polemas, Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> the old ſouldiers ſhew their skarres for witneſſe of their valour, and complaine not at all; you that complaine of yours, would hardly ſhew them, if Loue, as your Generall, to giue you a worthy reward, ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund to ſee them. Cruell Nymph, ſayd the knight, you deceiue your ſelfe, for I may onely ſay to him, Loue, put away thy skarfe, and behold the eyes of mine enemy, for he can no ſooner open his eies, but he ſhall ſee the wounds that I beare in my heart, not as you ſay, in my complaint, but in making it my glory, to haue ſo worthy an Author of my wounds. So that you may iudge, that if Loue will enter into reaſon with me, I can ſooner ſatisfie him than you, for hee can perceiue the blowes which you cannot, becauſe that the fire cannot burne it ſelfe; no more are you: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſenſible of your owne beauties, to be ſo of our teares, nor offended
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:177519:164"/>
where the armes of merit cannot reſiſt; if thoſe of pitty at the leaſt abate the ſharpeneſſe of your rigours, to the end, that they that adore you for faire, may commend you for courteous. <hi>Leonide</hi> loued this knight, but would not he ſhould know it as yet. But ſhe likewiſe feared, that putting him quite beſide all hope, ſhee might alſo make him loſe his courage: which was the cauſe that ſhe anſwered him, If your loue be ſuch, the time will giue mee more knowledge than theſe words, too well deliuered to proceed from affection. For, I haue heard ſay, affection cannot be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out paſſion, and paſſion wil not ſuffer the ſpirit to haue ſo free a diſcourſe. But when the time ſhall haue told me as much as you, you are to beleeue, that I am not of ſtone, nor ſo voyd of vnderſtanding, but your merits are knovvne to me, and your loue may moue me. Till then, hope not of me, no more than of the reſt of my company in generall. The Knight would haue kiſſed her hand for this aſſurance; but becauſe <hi>Galathee</hi> loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on, Knight, ſaid ſhe, be diſcreete, euery one hath eye on vs, if you do thus, you vndoe me.</p>
                  <p>And at this word ſhe roſe and came among vs that were gathering of flowres. Behold the firſt diſcouery that they had of their good wils, which gaue <hi>Galathee</hi> occaſion to meddle in it. For, perceiuing what had paſſed in the Garden; and hauing of long time a purpoſe to winne <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſhe would know that night, what was done betweene <hi>Leonide</hi> and him; and becauſe ſhe alvvaies made her ſelfe very familiar with you Neece, and had acquainted her with the particulars of her ſecrets, the Nymph durſt not altogether deny the truth of this loue-ſuite. It is true, that ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed what concerned her ovvne will: and vpon this diſcourſe <hi>Galathee</hi> would knovv the very words that they had vſed; wherein your Neece ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied her in part, and in part diſſembled. So it was, that ſhe ſaid enough to encreaſe the purpoſe of <hi>Galathee,</hi> ſo that from that day ſhe reſolued to be beloued of him, and vndertooke this worke with that cunning, that it was impoſſible it ſhould fall out othervviſe. At that meeting ſhee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade <hi>Leonide</hi> to go on in that affection, and after told her, that ſhe ſhould cut off all the rootes, becauſe ſhe knevv well, that <hi>Polemas</hi> had another deſſigne, and that this would ſerue but to delude her. Beſides that, if <hi>Amaſis</hi> came to knovvledge of it, ſhe would be offended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leonide,</hi> who at that time had no more malice than a childe, tooke the words of the Nymph, as from her Miſtriſſe, without ſearching into the cauſe, which made her ſay ſo, and ſo remained ſome dayes eſtranged from <hi>Polemas,</hi> who knevv not from whence it might grovve. At the firſt this made him more earneſt in his ſuite. For it is the ordinary cuſtome of yong
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:177519:165"/>
ſpirits, to deſire with more eagerneſſe, that which is hard to come by; and indeed he went on in that ſort, that <hi>Leonide</hi> had much enough to doe to diſſemble the good will ſhe bore him; and at laſt, knew ſo little how to doe it, that <hi>Polemas</hi> perceiued he was beloued. But ſee what Loue had appointed!</p>
                  <p>This young louer, after he had three or foure moneths continued this ſuite with the more violence, as he had the leſſe aſſurance of the good will he deſired: as ſoone, almoſt, as hee was certaine, loſt his violence, by little and little loued ſo coldly, that as Fortune and Loue, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to decline, fall at once, the Nymph perceiued not that ſhee alone went on in this affection. It is true, that <hi>Galathee,</hi> who came on, was, in part, the cauſe. For hauing a deſſigne on <hi>Polemas,</hi> ſhe vſed ſuch craft, and ſped ſo well, what by her authority, and what with time, that one might ſay, ſhee robbed her inſenſibly; for that, when <hi>Leonide</hi> handled him roughly, <hi>Galathee</hi> fauoured him: and when the other fled from his company, ſhe drew him to hers. And this continued ſo long, and ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, that <hi>Polemas</hi> beganne to turne his eyes towards <hi>Galathee,</hi> and ſhortly after, the heart followed: For ſeeing himſelfe fauoured by a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than her that neglected him, hee blamed himſelfe for ſuffering it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſence, and minded to embrace the fortune which came ſmiling on him. But O wiſe <hi>Adamas!</hi> you may ſee what a gracious encounter this was, and how it pleaſed Loue to play with their hearts. It is ſome while ſince, by the ordinance of <hi>Clidaman, Agis</hi> was allotted ſeruant vnto your Neece, and (as you know) by the election of Fortune.</p>
                  <p>Now though this young Knight was not giuen to <hi>Leonide</hi> out of his owne choyce, yet he agreed to the gift, and approoued it by the ſeruices which he afterward did performe, and that ſhe miſliked not, was ſhewed by her actions. But when <hi>Polemas</hi> beganne to ſerue her, <hi>Agis,</hi> as a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, that hath his eyes alwayes on his treaſure, tooke notice of the growing loue of this new Louer, and ſometimes complayned to her of it: but the coldneſſe of her anſwers (inſtead of extinguiſhing his iealouſies onely) by little and little deaded his loue; for conſidering what ſmall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance he had in his ſoule, he laboured to get a better reſolution then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he had had; and ſo, that he might not ſee another triumph ouer him, he choſe rather to withdraw farre off. A receit, that I haue heard ſay, is the beſt that a ſoule infected with this euill, can haue to free it ſelfe: for as loue, at the beginning, is brought forth by the eyes; ſo it ſeemeth that the contrary ſhould be for want of ſight, which can be in nothing more then abſence, where the forgetfull, couered as with aſhes, the ouer-liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:177519:165"/>
repreſentations of the thing beloued. And indeed, <hi>Agis</hi> happily attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his purpoſe: for he was hardly gone, but loue likewiſe parted from his ſoule, lodging in the place of it the neglect of this flitter: So that <hi>Leoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de</hi> purpoſing by this new plot to winne <hi>Polemas,</hi> loſt him that already was intirely hers. But the confuſions of Loue ended not heere: for he would, that <hi>Polemas</hi> likewiſe for his part, ſhould haue ſence of that which hee made the Nymph to feele. Almoſt about the ſame time, the affection of <hi>Lindamor</hi> tooke birth; and it fell out, that as <hi>Leonide</hi> had diſdained <hi>Agis</hi> for <hi>Polemas,</hi> and <hi>Polemas Leonide</hi> for <hi>Galathee,</hi> ſo <hi>Galathee</hi> diſdained <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> for <hi>Lindamor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To tell the follies of them all, would be an hard piece of worke. So it was, that <hi>Polemas</hi> ſeeing himſelfe payed in the ſame money in which hee payd your Neece, yet could not loſe not hope nor loue, but contrariwiſe ſearched al ſorts of plotting, to enter again into her fauor, but all in vaine. It is true, that as he could get nothing more to his owne benefit, yet hee hath ſo wrought, that he, who was the cauſe of his euill, is not come to bee poſſeſſor of his good: for whether it were by his cunning practices, or by the will of the gods, that a certaine deuout Druyde hath imparted to him, ſince that time <hi>Lindamor</hi> is no more beloued: and it ſeemeth, Loue hath a purpoſe not to ſuffer the heart of <hi>Galathee</hi> to be at reſt, the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the one being no ſooner defaced in her ſoule, but another takes place. And now behold vs at this houre reduced to the loue of a ſhepherd, who for a ſhepheard, in his quality may deſerue well, but not to be the ſeruant of <hi>Galathee;</hi> and yet is ſhe ſo paſſionate, that if her euill hold on, I know not what will become of her: So as I may well ſay, I ueuer ſawe ſuch a curioſity, nor ſo ſtrange a dreame as ſhe hath had, ſince ſhe endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red this euill. But this is not all: your wiſedome (ſage <hi>Adamas)</hi> in this which I am to tell you, muſt worke one of his ordinary effects.

O <hi>Adamas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Siluie,</hi> if you knew <hi>Celadon,</hi> as I doe, you would neuer haue this feare: he is ſo farre in loue with <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> that all the beauty of the world cannot pleaſe him, and after, we ſhall haue enough to looke to other things than to his healing. Faire <hi>Siluie,</hi> ſaid the Druide, you ſpeake well, like one that neuer knew what Loue meant, and as one that neuer felt his forces: This little god, the more power he hath ouer euery thing, the more ſport he makes with euery thing; ſo that when there is leaſt likelihood that he ſhould doe any thing, it is then eſpecially, that he is pleaſed to make his power to be knowne. Liue not you with that confidence, for that, as yet, there was neuer any ſort of vertue, that could be exempted from Loue.

To the end, ſaid he, that you might arme your ſelfe againſt the forces of that god, for feare, that being ouer-aſſured in the opinion that it is impoſſible, you bee not ouertaken before you are prepared. I haue heard ſay, that <hi>Celadon</hi> is ſo goodly, ſo diſcreete, and accompliſhed, that there is no perfection wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in him which may winne loue. If it be ſo, there is danger; for that the treaſons of loue are ſo hard to diſcouer, that as yet, there was neuer the man that could doe it. Leaue the paine to me, ſaid ſhe, and onely ſee what you will haue me doe in this buſineſſe we talke of. Me thinks, ſaid the Druyde, this warre muſt be made by the eye; and when I haue ſeene how the world goes, wee will diſpoſe of our affaires to the leaſt hurt that wee can; and in the meane time let vs keepe our deſſigne ſecret.</p>

The welcomes that he gaue to <hi>Leonide,</hi> were not ſmall: for, for the courteſie with which ſhe bound him, he loued and eſteemed well of her, though <hi>Siluies</hi> humour pleaſed him better. Within a while after, they fell in talke of <hi>Adamas,</hi> commending his Wiſedome, his Wit, and Bounty: whereupon <hi>Celadon</hi> asked if hee were not the Sonne of the great <hi>Pelion,</hi> of whom he had heard ſpoken ſo many maruailes. It is the ſame, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>Galathee,</hi> who is come expreſſely for your diſeaſe. O, Madame, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:177519:166"/>
the ſhepheard, it muſt be a good Phyſician that can heale that, but, I thinke, when he ſhall know it, he will ſooner deſpaire of my health, than dare to vndertake the cure. <hi>Galathee</hi> thought he ſpake of the ſickneſſe of his body. But, ſayd ſhe, is it poſſible you ſhould thinke you are ſtill ſicke? I aſſure my ſelfe, if you will, within two dayes you may leaue your bed. It may be, Madame, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> hee is neuer the better for that; for ſometimes we carry our ſickneſſe ſo hidden, that our ſelues know nothing till we be in extremity.</p>
                  <p>Their diſcourſe had held longer, had not the Druyde come to finde them, that he might ſee what was neceſſary for his purpoſe. He found him well diſpoſed for his body, for the diſeaſe had ſpent his fury and came to decline: but when hee ſpake to him, hee iudged his ſpirit diſtempered, though he was not of beleefe that it was for theſe Nymphs: and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the wiſe Phyſician ought alwaies to apply his remedy to the euill that is ready to offer violence, hee reſolued to begin his cure on <hi>Galathee.</hi> And on this deſigne, deſirous, at once, to be certified of the will of <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> at night, when al the Nymphs were gone, &amp; he tooke heed that <hi>Meril</hi> might not bee by, hauing ſhut the doore, hee ſpake in this ſort: I thinke, <hi>Celadon,</hi> your aſtoniſhment is not ſmall, to ſee your ſelfe ſuddenly rayſed to ſo good a fortune as that you now poſſeſſe; for I aſſure my ſelfe, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your hope, that being borne as you are, a ſhepheard, and bred in the villages, you now ſee your ſelfe cheriſhed of the Nymphs, made much of, and ſerued, I will not ſay of Ladyes, that haue beene vſed to be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but by her, that abſolutely commands ouer this Countrey: A for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, indeede, which the greateſt haue deſired, but whereto none could attaine but your ſelfe; for which you are to praiſe the gods, and giue them thanks, that they may continue it to you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adamas</hi> talked thus to him, that he might draw him to tell the truth of his affection; thinking, that by this meanes, making ſhew to approue it, he ſhould make him beſt diſcouer it. Whom the ſhepheard anſwered with a great ſigh, Father, if this be a good fortune, then muſt my taſte bee diſtempered, for I neuer felt more bitter Wormewood, than that which this fortune, that you call good, hath made me taſte, ſince I came to bee in the ſtate wherein you ſee me. And how, (added the Druyde, the better to couer his craft) is it poſſible you ſhould haue ſo ſmall knowledge of your good, that you ſee not to what greatneſſe this aduenture hath rayſed you? Alas, anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> it is that which threatens a greater fall. Why? doe you feare (ſaid <hi>Adamas)</hi> that this good lucke will not laſt? I feare, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the ſhepheard, it will laſt longer then I deſire. But wherefore is it,
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:177519:167"/>
that our ſheepe are aſtonied and dye, when they be long in a great water, and yet fiſhes delight and are nouriſhed in it? Becauſe, anſwered the Druyde, it is againſt their nature.</p>
                  <p>And think you, father (ſayd he) that it is leſſe againſt the nature of a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard to liue among ſo many Ladies? I am a ſhephard borne, and nothing can pleaſe me, that is not of mine owne condition. But is it poſſible (ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Druid) that ambition which ſeemes to be borne with man, cannot make you part from your woods, or that beauty, whoſe allurements are ſo ſtrong for a yong hart, cannot diuert you from your former purpoſe? The ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that euery one ought to haue (ſaid the ſhepherd) tis to do wel that which we are to do, and in that to bee the foremoſt among them of his condition, and the beauty which wee are to regard, and which ought to draw vs, is that which we may loue, not that which wee ſhould reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and may not looke on but with the eie of reſpect. Why (ſayd the Druide) do you conceit to your ſelfe, that there is a greatneſſe among men, to which merit and vertue cannot attaine? Becauſe (anſwered the the ſhepheard) I know that all things are to bee contained within the termes that nature hath ſet them; and that as there is no likelihood that a Ruby faire &amp; perfit, though it be may beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e a Diamo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, ſo he that hopes to raiſe himſelfe higher, or to ſpeake truer, to change nature, and make himſelfe other then that he is, loſes in vaine both his time and hispaines.</p>
                  <p>Then the Druide, aſtoniſhed at the conſiderations of the ſhepheard, and well pleaſed to ſee him ſo far remoued from the deſſines of <hi>Galathee,</hi> began againe in this ſort: Now my child, I praiſe the gods for that wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which I find in you, and aſſure you that if you carry your ſelfe thus, you ſhall giue the heauens cauſe to continue to you, all ſort of felicity. Many borne vp by their vanity, haue gone out of themſelues, vpon hope more vaine then theſe that I haue propounded. But what is befalne them? Nothin, g but after a long and incredible paine, repentance for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long time abuſed. You may thanke heauen, that hath giuen you this knowledge, before you haue occaſion to haue their repentance, and you are to entreat it to preſerue you, that you may continue in the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and ſweete life wherein you haue liued hitherto. But ſince you aſpire not to theſe greatnes nor theſe beauties, what is it then O <hi>Celadon</hi> that may ſtay you here among them? Alas (anſwered the ſhepheard) it is only the will of <hi>Galathee,</hi> who holds me almoſt like a priſoner. It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true, that if my ſickneſſe had permitted me, I had attempted to haue eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped by one meanes or other, though I knew the enterpriſe was full of difficulty; and if I could not haue the helpe of any other, ſetting all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:177519:167"/>
apart, I would haue gone away by force: for <hi>Galathee</hi> held mee ſo ſhort, and the Nymphs, when ſhe is not here, and little <hi>Merill,</hi> when the Nymphs cannot ſtay, that I know not which way to turne my foote, but they are at mine elbow. And when I would ſpeake to <hi>Galathee,</hi> ſhee ſets on me with reproches in ſuch a choler, that I muſt confeſſe I dare ſpeake no more to her; and this aboad hath bene ſo troubleſome to mee, that I may accuſe it as the principall cauſe of my diſeaſe. Now, if you euer had pitty on a perſon afflicted, deare father, I adiure you by the great gods, whom you ſo worthily ſerue, by your naturall bounty, and by the hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable memory of that great <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And after many other diſcourſes, he left him: but with ſuch contentment, that if <hi>Adamas</hi> would haue permitted him, hee would haue riſen at that inaſtnt.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, <hi>Leonide,</hi> that would not leaue <hi>Galathee</hi> long in the error wherein <hi>Climante</hi> had put her, that euening when ſhe ſaw <hi>Siluie,</hi> and the little <hi>Meril</hi> withdrawne, kneeled downe by the bed-ſide, and after ſome ordinary ſpeech ſhe went on, O Madam, what newes haue I met with in this iourney? and newes which concernes you? and I would not for any thing but I had knowne it, to cleere your errour. And what is it, anſwered the Nymph? It is (added <hi>Leonide)</hi> there hath beene put on you the cunningſt practice that euer loue inuented; and me thinks you ſhould not grieue at my iourney, though I had done no other thing. That Drui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, who is the cauſe of your ſtay here, is the wickedſt man, and the moſt crafty that euer ſet himſelfe to beguile any. And then ſhe told her from point to point what ſhe had heard from <hi>Clemanthe's</hi> mouth, and of <hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas;</hi> and that all this practice was inuented, but to diſpoſſeſſe <hi>Lindamor,</hi> and ſet <hi>Polemas</hi> in his place.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt, the Nymph ſtood a little aſtoniſhed, in the end, the loue of the ſhepheard that flattered her, perſwaded, that <hi>Leonide</hi> ſpake this out of deſpight, and to turne her from the loue of the ſhepheard, that ſhe might poſſeſſe him alone. So that ſhee beleeued nothing of that ſhee had told her: but contrarily turning into laughter, ſhe ſayd, <hi>Leonide,</hi> goe to bed, it may be, to morrow you will riſe vp more wife, and then you ſhall know
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:177519:168"/>
better to hide your craft; and with this word, turned to the other ſide, ſomewhat ſmiling: which offended <hi>Leonide</hi> ſo ſore, that ſhee reſolued to ſet <hi>Celadon</hi> at liberty, whatſoeuer it might coſt her. And in this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, the ſame euening ſhe went to ſeeke her vncle, to whom ſhe vſed this language: Father, ſince you ſee that <hi>Celadon</hi> is ſo well, what would you haue him do here longer? I haue not concealed from you, what <hi>Galathees</hi> will is.</p>
                  <p>Iudge what miſchiefe may befall. I would haue freed the Nymph from the abuſe whereto this Impoſtor <hi>Climanthe</hi> had perſwaded her, but ſhe is ſo wonne to <hi>Celadon,</hi> that all that labour to withdraw her, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared enemies, ſo that the ſureſt way is to remoue this ſhepheard from thence, which cannot be done without you: for the Nymph hath ſuch an eye to me, that I can turne no way but ſhee heeds me, and ſuſpects mee. <hi>Adamas</hi> was ſome what aſtonied to heare his neece talke thus, and was of opinion, that ſhe feared, the good will which ſhee bare the ſhepheard, was perceiued, and ſhe would preuent it: yet iudging that to cut off the roots of theſe louers, the beſt meanes was to remoue <hi>Celadon,</hi> and ſayd to his neece, the ſooner to diſcouer her plot, that he deſired that ſhe ſpake of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all things: but he knew not the meane. The meane (ſayd ſhe) is the moſt eaſie in the world, only get the cloathes of a Nymph, and dreſſe him in them, he is yong, and as yet hath no beard: by this deuice he may geta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way vnknowne, and no body the wiſer by whoſe helpe it was, and <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee</hi> ſhall neu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>r know whom to blame. <hi>Adamas</hi> found this inuention to bee good: and the ſooner to execute it, reſolued at that time, after the night were paſſed, to go ſeeke for ſuch an habit, vnder pretence of ſeeking for remedies to heale the ſhepheard, giuing <hi>Galathee</hi> to vnderſtand, that though the ſhepheard were freed from his feuers, yet hee was not cleere from danger of a relapſe, and they muſt preuent it with wiſedome. And communicated this deſſine to <hi>Siluie,</hi> who approued it, prouided that hee ſlacked not his returne. <hi>Celadon</hi> was not thorowly awaked, when <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee,</hi> and <hi>Leonide</hi> came into the chamber, in ſhew to know how hee did, and then <hi>Adamas,</hi> who knew well, ſeeing the great watchfulneſſe of the Nymphs, that delay was dangerous, after he had asked <hi>Celadon</hi> ſome ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary queſtions about his ſickneſſe, hee drew neere; and turning to the Nymph, wiſhed her to permit him to enquire of ſome particulars which he durſt not demand before her. <hi>Galathee,</hi> who beleeued it was concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſickneſſe, drew aſide and gaue way to <hi>Adamas,</hi> to acquaint the ſhepheard with his deſſine, promiſing him to come within two or three dayes at the furdeſt. <hi>Celadon</hi> coniured him by the ſtrongeſt prayers
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:177519:168"/>
he could, knowing well that without him this impriſonment would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer.</p>
                  <p>After he had giuen him aſſurance, hee went where <hi>Galathee</hi> was, and told her that the ſhepheard for the preſent was well: but as hee had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore told her, it was to be feared leſt he might relapſe, and to preuent the euill, it was neceſſary he ſhould go ſeeke that which was fit for him, and he would returne as ſoone as he had found them. The Nymph was well pleaſed with this, for on the one ſide ſhe deſired the intire recouery of the ſhepheard: and on the other, the preſence of the Druide began to trouble her, fore-ſeeing that ſhe could not conuerſe ſo freely with her beloued <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> as before ſhee had done, hee knew well what her purpoſe was: but he ſeemed not to heed it; and preſently after dinner, hee ſet himſelfe on the way, leauing the three Nymphs in ſome paine: for euery one had a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering deſſine, and all three being deſirous to effect it, it was neceſſary they ſhould be finely deluded. That was the cauſe, that all three were more vſually about his bed, but <hi>Siluie,</hi> aboue the reſt, that ſhe might keep them from ſpeaking in priuate to him: Yet could ſhe not keep ſo good watch: but <hi>Leonide</hi> found a time to tell him the reſolution, which ſhee had taken with her vncle, and then ſhe went on:</p>
                  <p>But tell true, <hi>Celadon,</hi> are you yet ſo without vnderſtanding, that when you haue receiued this good office from me, you will remember no more that you ſee at this preſent, the loue I beare you? At leaſt, call to your minde the wrongs that <hi>Galathee</hi> doth me, for your ſake; and if the loue which in all others meriteth loue, growing in me, cannot bring it forth in you, let me haue this contentment, to heare once from your owne mouth, that the affection of ſuch a Nymph as I am, is not altogether diſtaſtefull to you. <hi>Celadon,</hi> who had already knowne this growing loue, deſired it might die in the cradle: but fearing leſt the deſpite which ſhe conceiued, might cauſe in her contrary effects to the reſolution which ſhe had taken with her vncle, he purpoſed to giue her ſome words, that hee might not loſe her altogether, and thus anſwered her, Faire <hi>Leonide,</hi> what opinion may you haue of me, if forgetting <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> whom I haue ſo long ſerued, I ſhould begin a new amity? I ſpeake freely to you, for I know well, you are not ignorant of what I am.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Celadon,</hi> anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> hide not your ſelfe from me, I know as much of your affaires as your ſelfe. Then, faire Nymph, replied the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, if you know it, how can you wiſh that I ſhould force this loue which hath ſuch force in my foule, that my life and my will depend of it? But ſince you know what I am, reade in my actions paſſed, and ſee what
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:177519:169"/>
remaineth in me to ſatisfie you, and tell me what you would haue me do? <hi>Leonide,</hi> at this ſpeech was not able to hide her teares, as wiſe as ſhe was: after ſhe had conſidered how contrary to her duty it was to liue in this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, and that ſhe traueld in vaine, ſhe reſolued to be miſtris of her owne will; but for that it was ſo difficult a worke that ſhe could not attaine to it at once, there muſt be ſome time to prepare her humours, that they might be capable to receiue the aduice of wiſedome. And in this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe ſpake to him thus: Shepheard, I cannot (at this time) take the counſell that is neceſſary for me, to get ſufficient force; I muſt haue leiſure to gather together the powers of my ſoule: but remember you the offer you haue made me: for I meane to benefit my ſelfe by it. Their diſcourſe had held on longer, if <hi>Siluie</hi> had not interrupted them, who comming vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and addreſſing her ſelfe to <hi>Leonide,</hi> Siſter, ſaid ſhe, you know not that <hi>Fleurial</hi> is come, and hath ſo ouertaken the Guard of the gate, that he was with <hi>Galathee</hi> before we were aware. He hath giuen her let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and I know not whence they come: But it muſt be from ſome good place, for ſhee hath changed colour twice or thrice. <hi>Leonide</hi> preſently doubted it was <hi>Lindamor,</hi> which cauſed her to leaue the ſhepheard with <hi>Siluie,</hi> and went to <hi>Galathee</hi> to know the certaintie.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Siluie,</hi> ſeeing her ſelfe alone with him, beganne to entertaine him with that courteſie, that if there had beene any place for Loue, without doubt ſhe had had it. And ſee how Loue ſports himſelfe with contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our deſſignes! The other two Nymphs, with all their Art, ſought it, and could not effect it; and ſhe that regarded it nor, came neerer the mark than the others. By that, a man may know how free Loue is, ſince he will by tyed to nothing, but what pleaſes him. Whileſt <hi>Celadon</hi> was in this thought, <hi>Siluie,</hi> that ſought for nothing more than occaſion to ſet him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſcourſe, becauſe ſhe delighted much in his conuerſation, and to heare him ſpeake, ſaid, You will not thinke, ſhepheard, what pleaſure this hap to haue knowne you, brings to mee; and I ſweare to you, if <hi>Galathee</hi> would beleeue me, ſince her brother went out of this Countrey, we haue had your company more than heretofore. For, for aught that I ſee in you, I thinke there is pleaſure in your villages, and your honeſt liberties, ſince you are exempted from Ambition, and conſequently from troubles, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing without craft, and without backe-biting, which are the foure plagues that our life brings. Wiſe Nymph (anſwered the ſhepheard) this that you ſay, is more than true, if we were out of the power of Loue; but you muſt know, that the ſame effects, which Ambition bringeth foorth in Courts, Loue cauſeth to growe in our villages. For the enuy of a Riuall,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:177519:169"/>
is no leſſe than of a Courtier: and the artificiall practices of Louers and Shepheards giue no place to others. And that is the cauſe that ſlaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers retaine the ſame authority among vs, to make good their owne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as well as among you. It is true, that we haue one aduantage, that inſtead of two enemies that you haue, which is Loue and Ambition, we haue but one; and from thence it comes, that there be ſome things parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly among vs, which we may call happy, but none (as I ſuppoſe) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Courtiers; for they that loue not at all, neede not auoyde the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements of Ambition: and whoſo is not ambitious, ſhall not for it haue his ſoule frozen, to reſiſt the flames of many faire eies: ſo that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing but one enemy, we may the more eaſily reſiſt him, as <hi>Siluander</hi> hath done hitherto, a ſhepheard indeede repleate with many perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet more happy (a man may ſay, without offence,) than wiſe: for, though this may (in ſome ſort) proceed out of his wiſedome, yet this is it that I hold, That it is a great happineſſe, neuer to haue met with a beauty that pleaſed him: and hauing neuer found the beauty that drew him, he neuer had familiarity with any ſhepheardeſſe, which is the cauſe that he ſo preſerues his liberty, becauſe I thinke (for my part) that if one loue not elſe-where, it is impoſſible for him to conuerſe long with an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable beauty, but he muſt loue it. <hi>Sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ie</hi> anſwered him, I haue ſo ſmall knowledge in this learning, that I muſt referre my ſelfe to what you ſay: yet doe I thinke, that it muſt be ſome other thing than beauty that cauſes loue; otherwiſe, the Lady that is loued of one, ſhould be ſo of all. There be many anſwers (ſaid the ſhepheard) to this obiection. For all beauties are not ſeene of one eie, ſo that as among colours, there be that pleaſe ſome, and diſpleaſe others, ſo wee may ſay of beauties; for all eyes doe not iudge alike: beſides that, theſe faire looke not on all with the ſame eie, and one ſhall pleaſe ſuch whom ſhe indeuoureth to pleaſe, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other quite contrary, whom ſhe ſeekes not to be pleaſing vnto. But, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all theſe reaſons, mee thinkes, that of <hi>Siluander</hi> was very good, when one demaunded of him, why he was not in loue? He anſwered, he neuer yet found his Loue-ſtone, and when he found ſuch an one, he knew well, he muſt infallibly loue as others did. And (anſwered <hi>Siluie)</hi> whom meant he by the Loue-ſtone? I know not (replied the ſhepheard) whether I can better inſtruct you: For he is well ſtudied, and among vs we hold him for a man of great vnderſtanding. Hee ſayes hee learned it from the Druydes, that when the great God formed all our ſoules, hee touched e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery of them with a piece of a Loue-ſtone, and that after, he put all thoſe pieces into a place apart; and likewiſe thoſe of the women, after hee had
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:177519:170"/>
touched them, he locked them into another ſtore-houſe by it ſelfe. Afte, when hee ſent the ſoules into the body, hee brought foorth thoſe of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, where are the loue-ſtones, which touched thoſe of the men, and thoſe of men to thoſe of women, and cauſed them to faſten each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If there be wicked ſoules, they take more pieces, which they hide. It happens, that as ſoone as the ſoule is in the body, and that it meeteth with it that is his loue-ſtone, it is impoſſible but hee ſhould loue: and from hence proceed all the effects of loue. For, as for them that are belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of many, it is for that they were theeuiſh, and had taken more pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as for that which loues euery one, and is not beloued, it is for that he had his loue-ſtone, and ſhe had not hers.</p>
                  <p>Many oppoſitions were made, when he ſpake theſe things: but hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered them all very well. Among others, I ſaid, But what would he ſay, that diuers times one ſhepheard loues diuers ſhepheardeſſes? That is, ſaid he, for that the piece of loue which touched it, being among others when the god mixed them, brake, and being in diuers pieces, they all, as many as there were, drew to them that ſoule.</p>
                  <p>But withall, marke, that thoſe perſons which are taken with diuers loues, loue not much: that is, for that theſe little pieces, beeing ſeparated, haue not that force as if they were vnited. Moreouer, he ſaid, that hence it comes, that we ſee often ſome in loue with others, which in our eyes, haue nothing amiable in them: whence proceede likewiſe, thoſe ſtrange loues that fall out ſometimes, that a <hi>Gaule</hi> bred vp among the moſt beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull Ladyes, came to loue a barbarous ſtranger. It was <hi>Dia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e</hi> that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him what he ſayd of <hi>Tymon</hi> of <hi>Athens,</hi> that neuer loued any, nor any loued him? His piece of loue, ſaid he, either was in the great gods Store<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe when he came into the world; or ſhe which had it, dyed in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; or before that <hi>Tymon</hi> was borne, or of yeeres to know her. So that euer ſince, when we ſee any that is not beloued, wee ſay, his piece of Loue was forgotten. And what ſayd he (ſaid <hi>Siluie)</hi> of that, that no man loued <hi>Tymon?</hi> That ſometimes (anſwered <hi>Celadon)</hi> the great god reckoned the ſtones that remained, and finding the number diſagreeing, becauſe ſome of the theeuiſh ſoules had taken more (as I haue told you) that hee might ſet the pieces in their euen number, the ſoules which were then ready to enter into the body, carried none with them. And thence it comes, that ſometimes we ſee ſhepheardeſſes compleate enough, which are ſo neglected, that none loue them. But the gracious <hi>Corilas</hi> asked him a queſtion concerning himſelfe at that time, what hee would ſay of one, that hauing long time loued, came to leaue her and to loue another. <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uander</hi>
                     <pb n="345" facs="tcp:177519:170"/>
anſwered to this, that the piece of Loue that changed, was broken, and that that which he firſt loued, ſhould haue had a greater piece than the other for whom he left her. And as when we ſee yron betweene two loadſtones, ſuffers it ſelfe to be drawne by that which hath moſt ſtrength, ſo the ſoule leaues it ſelfe to bee carried by the ſtronger part of his loue. Truely, ſaid <hi>Siluie,</hi> this ſhepheard muſt be gentle, hauing ſo good conceits, but tell me, I pray you, what he is. It will be hard for me (anſwered <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon)</hi> to tell, for himſelfe knowes not; yet wee hold him to be of a good houſe, according to the iudgement that may be made of his good quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: for you muſt know, that it is ſome yeeres ſince he came to dwell in our village, with ſmal meanes, &amp; without knowledge of himſelfe, but that he ſayd hee came from the Lake <hi>Leman,</hi> where he was bred a childe.</p>
                  <p>So it was, that after hee was knowne, euery one helped him: beſides that, hauing knowledge of herbes, and of the nature of beaſts, the beaſts profited ſo well vnder his hands, that there is none that deſires not to put them to him, whereof hee makes ſo good an account, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the profit that he makes thereof, there are few that gratifie him not with ſomething, ſo that at this houre he is in good caſe, and may call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe rich: for, O faire Nymph, we want not much to make vs ſo: for that nature being contented with a few things, we ſeeke after nothing but to liue according to it; we are as ſoone rich as content, and our content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment being eaſily compaſſed, our riches are quickly gotten. You are (ſayd <hi>Siluie)</hi> more happy then we.</p>
                  <p>But you told me of <hi>Diane:</hi> I know her not, but by ſight: tell me, I pray you, who was her mother? That is <hi>Bellinde,</hi> anſwered he, wife of the wiſe <hi>Celion,</hi> who dyed young. And <hi>Diane,</hi> ſayd <hi>Siluie,</hi> what is ſhee? and what is her humour? She is, ſaid <hi>Celadon,</hi> one of the faireſt ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes of <hi>Lignon;</hi> and, if I were not partiall for <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> I would ſay ſhee were the faireſt: for, in truth, beſides that ſhee is to the eye, ſhee hath ſo many beauties in her ſpirit, that there is nothing ſuperfluous nor defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue. Many times, three or foure of vs ſhepheards, haue beene together, to conſider of her, not knowing what perfection might be wiſhed for, that ſhe had not: for though ſhe loue nothing of loue, yet loues ſhee all vertue with ſo ſincere a will, that ſhe binds more to her by that ſort, then others moſt violent affections. And how, ſaid <hi>Sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The deceit, anſwered <hi>Celadon,</hi> which the father of <hi>Filidas</hi> did her, is the hinderance that there are none now, and indeede, it was one of the moſt not able that euer I heard of. If it were not painefull to you, added <hi>Siluie,</hi> I would bee glad to learne it of you, and alſo to know who this <hi>Celion</hi>

was, and who this <hi>Bellinde.</hi> I feare, anſwered the ſhepheard, the diſcourſe will be ſo long, that it will trouble you. On the contrary, ſaid the Nymph, We know not better how to imploy the time, while <hi>Galathee</hi> reades the letters that ſhe went to receiue. Then, to ſatisfie your commandement, anſwered he, I will doe it as briefly as I can: and then hee held on in this ſort:</p>

Hard by her houſe lodged another ſhepheard, called <hi>Leon,</hi> with whom neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood had tyed a ſtrong bond of amity: and fortune vnwilling to doe more for the one then for the other, gaue him likewiſe at the ſame time a daughter, whoſe youth gaue great promiſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ture beauty; ſhe was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Amaranthe.</hi> The friendſhip of the fathers cauſed that of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to encreaſe, by frequenting together: for they were bred vp toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the cradle, and when their age permitted them, they led their ſtlocks alike, &amp; at night brought them in companies to their lodgings. But becauſe, as they grew in body, their beauty likewiſe encreaſed to the view of the eye, there were many ſhepheards that ſought their loue, whoſe feruices and affections could not obtaine more of them, then that they were receiued with courteſie.</p>
                  <p>It fell out, that <hi>Celion,</hi> a young ſhepheard of thoſe quarters, hauing loſt a ſheep, came to ſeek it among <hi>Bellindes</hi> flock, whither it was ſtrayed. She reſtor it with ſuch courteſie, that the recouery of his ſheep was the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the loſſe of himſelfe; and fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that time he began to feele with what force two faire eies were able to offend: for before he was ſo ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that the very thoght of it neuer came into his ſoule. But what ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ſoeuer was in him, it brought him to that paſſe, that it made him by his woo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:177519:171"/>
know what his diſeaſe was, and the onely Phyſician from whom hee was to haue his health. So that <hi>Bellinde</hi> by his actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s perceiued it almoſt as ſoon as himſelfe: for, at the firſt he knew not what to ſay his deſigne was: but his affect on growing with his age, came to that greatneſſe, that hee found the diſcommodity in good earneſt, and then acknowledged it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtrained to change the paſtimes of his youth into a very curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purſuite. And <hi>Bellinde</hi> on the other ſide, though ſhe were ſerued of many, receiued his affection aboue any other, yet no otherwiſe, then if he had bene her brother, which ſhe made appeare one day, when he thought to haue found the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity to declare his good will. She kept her flocke along the riuer of <hi>Lignon,</hi> and beheld her beauty in the water. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the ſhepheard taking occaſion, ſayd to her, holding after an amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous faſhion his hand before his eyes, Take heede, faire ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, withdraw your eyes from this water, feare you not the dangers that others haue runne into by ſuch actions? Why ſay you ſo, anſwered <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde,</hi> that as yet vnderſtood him not? Ah then, ſaid the ſhepheard, faire and diſſembling ſhepheardeſſe, you repreſent within this happy riuer, more beauty then <hi>Narciſſus</hi> in the fountaine.</p>
                  <p>At theſe words <hi>Bellinde</hi> bluſhed, and that encreaſed her beauty the more, yet ſhee anſwered, Since whence, <hi>Celion,</hi> haue you wiſhed mee ſo well? without doubt, it is well done of you. To wiſh you well ſaid the ſhepheard, it is long time ſince I did it, and you are to beleeue, that this will ſhall be limited by no other termes then that of my life.</p>
                  <p>Then the ſhepheardeſſe caſting down her head on this ſide, ſaid, I make no doubt of your amity, receiuing it with the ſame good will, that I offer you mine. Where to <hi>Celion</hi> preſently anſwered, Let me kiſſe that faire hand by way of thankes, for ſo great a good, and for an earneſt of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruice, which <hi>Celion</hi> is to render you the reſt of his life. <hi>Bellinde,</hi> knew as well by the feruour wherewith he vttered theſe words, as by the kiſſes which he imprinted on her hand, that he figured to himſelfe his ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of another quality then ſhe meant; and becauſe ſhee would not haue him liue in this error, <hi>Celion</hi> (ſayd ſhe) you are far from that you thinke: you cannot ſooner baniſh me from your company, then by this meanes, if you deſire that I ſhould continue the amity I haue promiſed you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue likewiſe yours, with the ſame honeſty that your vertue promiſes me: otherwiſe, hence forth I breake all familiarity with you, and proteſt neuer to loue you. I may as the cuſtome of them that are beloued, is, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe you: but I vſe it not, becauſe I freely wiſh you ſhould know, that if you liue otherwiſe then you ought, you are neuer to haue hope in my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity.
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:177519:172"/>
She added yet other words, which ſo aſtonied <hi>Celion,</hi> that he knew not what to anſwere: Only he caſt himſelfe on his knees, and without o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcourſe, with this ſubmiſſion demanded pardon, and then proteſted to her, that his amity proceeded from her, and that ſhe might rule it as that which ſhe had bred. If you vſe your ſelfe thus (replied then <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linde)</hi> you ſhall bind me to loue you, otherwiſe you ſhall conſtraine me to the contrary. Faire ſhepheardeſſe (replied he) my affection is borne, and ſuch as it is, it muſt liue, for it cannot die but with mee, ſo that I cannot well remedy it but by time: yet to promiſe you, that I will ſtudy to make ſuch as you command, I ſweare it vnto you, and in the meane time, I deſire neuer to be honored with your good fauour, if in all my life you knew any action, that for the quality of my affection may diſpleaſe you.</p>
                  <p>At laſt the ſhepheard conſented to bee beloued, on condition ſhee might know nothing in him, which might offend her honeſty. So theſe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers began an amity, which laſted very long, with ſuch ſatiſfaction to them both, that they had cauſe to reioyce therein for their fortune. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, if the yong ſhepheard were letted, hee ſent his brother <hi>Diamis</hi> to her, who vnder the colour of ſome fruite, brought her letters from his brother. She often returned anſwere with ſuch good will, that hee had cauſe to be contented, and this affection was carried with that prudence, that few perceiued it. <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> though ſhe were ordinarily with them, was ignorant of it, had it not bene that by hap ſhe found a letter which her companions had loſt; and ſee, I beſeech you, what the effect was, and how dangerous a thing it is for a yong ſoule to come neere theſe fires! Vntill this time, the ſhepheardeſſe had not, not only the lesſt feeling of loue; but not a thought to be beloued; and as ſoone as ſhee ſaw this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were it for that ſhe bare ſome enuy to her companion, whom ſhee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>d not to be the fairer, &amp; yet ſhe ſaw her often wooed by this honeſt ſhepheard, were it for that ſhe was of an age which is proper to ſuch bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that they can no ſooner come neere the fire, but they feele it, were it for that this letter had ſo liuely heates, that ſhe had noyce to reſiſt them. So it was, that ſhe tooke a certaine deſire not to loue, for loue it may be, would not attache her at the firſt in extremity, but to be loued, &amp; ſerued of ſome ſhepheard of worth; and in this point, ſhee read the letter often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which was thus:</p>

with as much of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentment, as they haue produced in me of vaine hope.

Yet can they hardly deny it, if they conſider well who ſhe is, hauing no likelihood that any other beauty then theirs could do ſo much. And yet, as if you had a purpoſe to equall your cruelty to your beauty, you haue ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that the affection which you haue cauſed to be borne, ſhall cruelly die in me.

                     <hi>Amaranthe</hi> read this letter ouer diuers times, and without heed ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king dranke vp the ſweete poyſon of loue, no otherwiſe then one weary ſuffers himſelfe by little to fall aſleepe. If her thought ſet before her eies the face of the ſhepheard, oh! how full of beauty found ſhe it to be? if his behauiour, how pleaſing did it ſeeme? if his ſpirit, how admirable did ſhe iudge it? briefely, ſhe ſaw him ſo perfect, that ſhe thought her companion happy to be beloued of him. Then taking againe the letter, ſhe read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: but not without much pawſing on the ſubiects that touched her moſt at the heart. And when ſhe came to the end, and that ſhee ſawe the reproach of cruell, ſhe flattered her deſires, which lately borne, call for foeble hopes as their Nurces, with opinion that <hi>Bellinde,</hi> as yet loued him not, and ſo ſhe might more eaſily winne him.

                  <p>This anſwer had beene ſufficient to haue diuerted her, if Loue had not been of the nature of powder, which is then moſt violent, when it is moſt reſtrained. For againſt thoſe former difficulties ſhe oppoſed ſome ſort of reaſon, that <hi>Celion</hi> ought not ſo ſoone to leaue <hi>Bellinde,</hi> it would be too great lightneſſe, if at the firſt ſummons hee ſhould be gone. But Time taught her to her coſt to deceiue her ſelfe. For after that day the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard diſdained her ſo that he ſhunued her, and often choſe rather to be abſent from <hi>Bellinde,</hi> than to be forced to ſee her. It was then that ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily ſhe ſhipped her ſelfe on ſo dangerous a ſea, and ſo notable for the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary ſhipwracks of them that ventured on them, and not long able to beare out this diſpleaſure, ſhe grew ſo ſad, that ſhee fled from her compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and the places where in before ſhe delighted, and at laſt, fell ſicke in good earneſt. Her deare <hi>Bellinde</hi> went preſently to ſee her, and vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares deſired the ſhepheard to beare her company. But as the ſight of the good we cannot get, doth but increaſe the deſire; ſo this viſitation did but make <hi>Amaranthes</hi> euill worſe.</p>
                  <p>The night being come, all the ſhepheardeſſes withdrew, and there ſtayed but <hi>Bellinde</hi> with her, ſo ſorry for the euill of her companion (for
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:177519:173"/>
ſhe knew not what it was) that ſhe tooke no reſt; and when ſhee asked her of it, for anſwer ſhe had nothing but ſighes. Whereat <hi>Bellinde</hi> at the firſt being aſtonied, in the end, offended with her, ſaid, I neuer thought, <hi>Amaranthe</hi> had ſo little loued <hi>Bellinde,</hi> that ſhe could haue concealed any thing from her; but by that I ſee I was deceiued. And where as I might haue ſaid heretofore, I had a friend, I may now ſay, I loue a diſſembler. <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> who for ſhame had ſhut vp her mouth vntill then, ſeeing they were alone; and being preſſed with ſuch an affection, reſolued to trie the laſt remedy, which ſhe thought fitteſt for her defence. Caſting from her all ſhame, as farre off as ſhe could, twice or thrice, ſhe opened her mouth to tell her all, but her words died ſo betweene her lippes, that this was all ſhe could do, to bring foorth theſe broken words, laying her hand ouer her eyes, as not daring to looke on her to whom ſhe ſpake: My deare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion (ſayd ſhe) for ſo they called themſelues: Our amity will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to hide any thing from you, knowing well, that though it be told you, what concernes me, ſhal be as carefully kept ſecret by you, as by my ſelfe. Excuſe then, I beſeech you, the extreme error, which to ſatisfie our amity, I am conſtrained to diſcouer to you. You aske me what my griefe is, and whence it comes; know, that it is Loue borne from the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a ſhepheard. But alas! at this word ouercome with ſhame and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, turning her head another way, ſhe held her peace with a torrent of teares.</p>
                  <p>The aſtoniſhment of <hi>Bellinde</hi> could not make her coniecture; yet to giue her courage to make an end, ſhe ſaid; I did not thinke that a paſſion ſo common to all, would haue brought you this trouble. To loue, is a thing ordinary; but, that it is from the perfections of a ſhepheard, this happens but to perſons of iudgement. Tell me then who this happy man is. Then <hi>Amaranthe</hi> taking her ſpeech againe, with a ſigh drawne from the depth of her heart, ſaid; But alas! this ſhepheard loues elſe-where. And who is he, ſaid <hi>Bellinde?</hi> It is (anſwered ſhe) ſince you will know, your <hi>Celion.</hi> I ſay yours (my companion) becauſe I know he loues you, and that this ſole amity makes him diſdaine mine. Excuſe my folly, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeming to know it, leaue me alone to complaine, and endure mine euill. The wiſe <hi>Bellinde</hi> was ſo aſhamed when ſhe heard this diſcourſe of the error of her companion, that though ſhe loued <hi>Celion,</hi> as well as any might be loued, yet ſhe reſolued on this occaſion to giue proofe of that ſhe was not. And therefore turning towards her, ſhe ſaid: Indeed, <hi>Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranthe,</hi> I ſuffer in paine more than I can ſpeake of, to ſee you ſo tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this affection: for it ſeemeth, our ſex will not permit vs ſo intire an
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:177519:174"/>
authority of loue; but ſince you are in theſe termes, I thanke God it lights in ſuch a place, that I may giue proofe of what I am to you. I loue <hi>Celion,</hi> I will not deny it, as if hee were my brother. But I loue you alſo as my ſiſter, and I wiſh (for I know hee will obey me) that he loue you more than mee; reſt your ſelfe on mee, and reioyce you alone, prouided, you acknowledge when you are recouered, what <hi>Bellinde</hi> hath beene vnto you.</p>
                  <p>After ſome other like diſcourſe, the night conſtrained <hi>Bellinde</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, leauing <hi>Amaranthe</hi> with ſuch contentment, that forgetting her ſadneſſe, in few dayes ſhee recouered her former beauty. In the meane time <hi>Bellinde</hi> was not without paine, who ſtudying for ſome meane to make her purpoſe knowne to <hi>Celion,</hi> found at laſt as fit a commodity as ſhe wiſhed. By fortune ſhe met him, as he was playing with his Ram in the great paſture, where the greateſt part of the ſhepheards fed their flockes. This beaſt was the leader of the troopes, and ſo well taught, that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to vnderſtand his maſter when he ſpake to him. Whereat the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſe took ſuch pleaſure, that ſhe ſtayed long at it. At laſt ſhe would trie if it knew her as well as him; but it was much more ready to euerie thing ſhee willed; whereupon drawing aſide from the company, ſhee ſaid to <hi>Celion:</hi> What thinke you, brother, of the acquaintance betweene your Ramme, and me? It is the pleaſanteſt that euer I ſawe.</p>
                  <p>Such as it is, faire ſhepheardeſſe (ſayd he) if you will do me the honor to receiue it, it is yours. But you are not to wonder that he giues you all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſance: for he knowes well, I would elſe diſclame him for mine, hauing learned by ſo many ſongs which hee hath heard of mee, as I paſſe vp and downe, that I was more yours then mine owne. This well expreſſes (ſaith the ſhepheardeſſe) the obedience of your Ram, which I wil not receiue to to bee emploied, more for you then mee: but ſince you giue mee ſo intire power ouer you, I will try it, by ioyning to a commandement a moſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionat prayer. There is nothing (anſwered the ſhepheard) which you may not command me. Then <hi>Bellinde,</hi> thinking ſhe had found the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity ſhe ſought for, purſued her diſcourſe thus: from the day that that you aſſured me of your amity, I iudged the ſame good will to be in you, ſo alſo it bindeth mee, to loue and honor you, more then any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon liuing. Now, though I ſay thus to you, I would not haue you thinke that I haue diminiſhed this good will: for it ſhall accompany mee to my graue: and yet it may be you would do it, if I had not forewarned you: but bind me by beleeuing that my life, and not my amity may diminiſh. Theſe words put <hi>Celion</hi> into much paine, not knowing whereto they tended, at
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:177519:174"/>
laſt hee anſwered, that hee attended her will, with great ioy and great feare; with ioy, for that he could imagine nothing more beneficial to him, then the honor of her commandements; and with feare, for that he knew not for what cauſe ſhe threatned him: yet death it ſelfe could not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome to him, if it befell him by her commandement. Then <hi>Bellinde</hi> held on:</p>
                  <p>Since, beſides your ſayings at this time, you haue alwayes giuen mee that witneſſe of this aſſurance which you make mee, that with reaſon I cannot doubt; I will make no more difficulty, not to intreate, but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iure <hi>Celion</hi> by all the amity with which he fauours his <hi>Bellinde,</hi> to obey her at this time. I will not command him a thing impoſſible, much leſſe draw him from the affection which he beares me: rather on the contrary I will, if it may be, that he encreaſe it more and more. But before I paſſe further, let me know, I beſeech you, if euer your amity hath bene of other quallity then it is now, <hi>Celion,</hi> then ſhewing a countenance leſſe troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then that which before the doubt had conſtrained him to haue, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that he began t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

On my faith, brother (replyed the ſhepheardeſſe) for ſo I will hold you the remainder of my life, you ſo bind me by liuing thus with mee, that neuer any of your actions euer got more ouer my ſoule then this. But I cannot ſee you longer in paine. Know then, that that which I would haue of you, is onely, that preſeruing inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably this good amity which you now beare me, you place your loue on one of the faireſt ſhepheardeſſes of <hi>Lignon.</hi> You may ſay this is a ſtrange office for <hi>Bellinde:</hi> yet if you conſider that ſhe, of whom I ſpeake, would haue you for her husband, and that ſhe is, after you, the perſon whom I moſt loue, for it is <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> I aſſure my ſelfe you will not wonder at it. She hath intreated, and I command you by all the power I haue ouer you.</p>
                  <p>She made haſte to giue him this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, fearing that if ſhe ſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed long, ſhe ſhould not haue the power to reſiſt the ſupplications which ſhe foreſaw.

At laſt, when he could ſpeake, with ſuch a voyce as they haue that are in the midſt of puniſhment, he cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Ah, cruell <hi>Bellinde,</hi> haue you preſerued my life till now, to take it from me with ſuch inhumanity? This commandement is too cruell, to let me liue, and my affection too great, to let mee die without deſpaire. Alas, ſuffer me to dye: but let me die faithfull: that if there be no meane to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> but by my death, I may ſacrifice my ſelf moſt willingly for her health: the change of this commandement ſhall be no leſſe witneſſe that I am beloued of you, then whatſoeuer you ſhall be able to do to me. <hi>Bellinde</hi> was moued, but not changed. <hi>Celion</hi> (ſayd ſhee) let vs leaue all theſe idle words, you ſhall giue me leſſe occaſion to beleeue what you ſay to me, if you will not ſatiſfie the firſt requeſt, which I make you.

                  <p>It was impoſſible, but <hi>Bellinde</hi> muſt haue feeling of theſe words, which ſhee knew came from an entire affection, but it was not poſſible for theſe words to diuert her from her deſſigne.

One day <hi>Bellinde</hi> deſirous to ſound him, propounded it as a friend, and he that iudged it fit, agreed willingly to it: and this marriage was farre forward without the knowledge of <hi>Celion.</hi> But when he perceiued it, he could not be letted from finding a meane to talke with <hi>Bellinde,</hi> to giue her ſuch reproches, that ſhe was almoſt aſhamed: and the ſhepheard ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he muſt vſe other remedy than words, ranne preſently to the beſt, that was, to his father, to whom he made this ſpeech: I ſhall be very ſorry to diſobey you at any time, and leſſe in this than any other. I ſee, you like well of the alliance of <hi>Amaranthe:</hi> you may well know, that there is not a ſhepheardeſſe that I affect more: yet I loue her for a miſtris, but not for a wife; and I beſeech you commaund me not to tell the cauſe. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at this ſpeech, ſuſpected that he had found ſome bad condition in the ſhepheardeſſe, and in his ſoule commended his ſonnes wiſedome that had that command ouer his affections: ſo that blowe was broken: and for that the thing was ſo farre paſſed, that many knew it; many alſo asked why it proceeded ſo coldly? the father could not chooſe but ſay ſomewhat to his moſt familiars, and they to others, that at laſt it came to <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> who at the firſt tormented her ſelfe much, but afterward ſetting before her ſelfe what her folly was, to ſeeke to make him loue her by force, by little and little ſhe fell off, and the firſt occaſion that ſhee ſawe fit and conuenient to marry her ſelfe, ſhee tooke hold on. So theſe louers were eaſed of a burden ſo hard to be borne. But this was not, but that they might be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-charged with another much more heauy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellinde</hi> was now of age to be married, and <hi>Philemon</hi> infinitely deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to beſtow her, to haue in his old dayes the contentment to behold himſelfe renewed in that which might come of her.

And in the meane time <hi>Ergaste,</hi> a principall ſhepheard of that Countrey, and who was well eſteemed of euery one for his commendable vertues, procured that ſhee was demaunded; and becauſe hee would not haue it vented before hee were aſſured; he which managed the buſineſſe, dealt ſo ſecretly and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as the promiſe of marriage was as ſoone knowne as it was demaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

At the firſt ſhee found the reſolution hard which ſhe was to take, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a man whom ſhe had neuer ſeene: yet that good ſpirit that neuer ſtoopes vnder the burden of misfortune, rayſed vp it ſelfe preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ouercomming that diſpleaſure, and would not ſuffer onely her eye to giue figne of ſorrow for that conſideration. But ſhe could neuer obtaine this ouer her ſelfe for <hi>Celion:</hi> and of neceſſity, her teares muſt pay the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of her ouer-obſtinate hatred of marriage. So it was, that to ſatisfie (in ſome ſort) her promiſe, ſhe aduertiſed the poore ſhepheard, that <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon</hi> would marry her. On the ſudden, hauing the permiſſion ſo much deſired, hee ſo ſollicited his father, that the ſame day he ſpake with <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now was no time, for which the father of <hi>Bellinde</hi> was much grieued, for hee loued him better than <hi>Ergaste.</hi> O God! what was the ſorrow when he knew the award of his misfortune? hee went out of the houſe, and ceaſed not, vntill he found out the ſhepheardeſſe. At the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he could not ſpeake, but his face manifeſted well enough what <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemons</hi> anſwer was. And though ſhe ſtood in as great need of good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell as he, and ſtrength to ſupport this blowe; yet would ſhe declare her ſelfe as wel vn-vanquiſhed by this diſpleaſure, as ſhe had alwayes gloried to be in all others. But likewiſe would ſhe not appeare to be ſo inſenſible, but the ſhepheard might haue ſome knowledge that ſhe felt her euill, and that it diſpleaſed her. Whereupon ſhe demaunded, to what the demand which hee made to her father amounted? The ſhepheard anſwered her with the ſame words that <hi>Philemon</hi> had ſaid to him, adding ſo many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and deſperate laments, that ſhe had beene a Rocke, if ſhe had not beene moued. Yet ſhee interrupted him, fighting againſt her ſelfe with more vertue than is credible, and told him, that complaints are proper to weake ſpirits, and not to perſons of courage: That he did himſelfe great wrong, and her alſo, to vſe that language. And (ſayd ſhe) at laſt, what is become of that good reſolution which you ſaid you would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all accidents, but the change of my amity? and can you haue an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that any thing can ſhake it? Do you not ſee that theſe words can not boot vs anything, but to make them that heare vs conceiue an euill opinion of vs? For Gods ſake do not ſet a ſtayne in my fore-head, which with ſuch paine I haue hitherto auoyded: and ſince there is none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedy, pacifie your ſelfe, as I doe; and (it may be) the Heauens will turne all things more to our contentment, than at this time wee are permitted to wiſh for. For my part I wil breake this misfortune as much as I can poſſibly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:177519:177"/>
But if there be no remedy, yet muſt not we be without reſolution, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let vs part aſunder.</p>
                  <p>Theſe laſt words brought the deſpaire of all, making him thinke, that this great courage proceeded from ſmall amity. If it were as eaſie for me, anſwered the ſhepheard, to reſolue againſt this accident, as you, I would iudge my ſelfe vnworthy to be beloued; for ſo feeble an amity cannot merit ſo great happineſſe. Well, for end and reward of my ſeruices, you giue me a reſolution in the aſſured loſſe which I ſee of you, and ſecretly to ſay to me, that I muſt not deſpaire, though I ſee you become anothers. Ah <hi>Bellinde,</hi> with what eye will you ſee this new friend? With what heart can you loue him? And with what fauors will you entertaine him, ſince your eye hath a thouſand times promiſed, that it would looke on none other with loue but me; and ſince this heart hath ſworne to me, that it could neuer loue any but me; and ſince loue hath deſtined your fauours to no leſſe affection then mine? Well, you command mee to leaue you: to obey you, I will doe ſo; for I will not at the end of my life, beginne to diſobey. But that which makes me vndertake it, is, to know aſſuredly, that the end of my life ſhall not happen, before the end of your amity; &amp; though I call my ſelfe the moſt vnhappy that liues, yet I cheriſh my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune the more, for that it hath preſented vnto me ſuch an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to make my loue knowne to you, that you may not doubt of it: and yet I ſhall not be ſatisfied in my ſelfe, if the laſt moment that remaines, be not employed in aſſuring you. I pray the heauen (ſee what my amity is!) that in this new election, it fill you with as much happineſſe, as you cauſe in me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire. Liue happy with <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> and receiue him with as great content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I haue had will to doe you ſeruice, if my dayes would haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me, that this new affection, full of pleaſures, which you promiſe to your ſelfe, may accompany you to your graue, as I assure you, that my faithfull amity ſhall cloſe mine eyes for your ſake, with extreme griefe.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Bellinde</hi> let <hi>Celion</hi> talke ſo long, it was for feare, that ſpeaking, her teares would doe the office of words, and that, that would encreaſe the griefe of the ſhepheard, or that it would giue proofe of the ſmall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer ſhe had ouer her ſelfe. Proud beauty, that loueſt rather to be iudged to haue too little loue, then too little reſolution! But at laſt, finding her ſtrengthned enough to giue anſwer, ſhe ſayd, <hi>Celion,</hi> you thinke you giue me proofe of your amity, and you doe the contrary: for, how haue you loued me, hauing ſo euil an opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of me? If ſince this laſt accide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t you haue conceiued it, beleeue the affection was not great, which could ſo readily ſuffer a change: But if you had no euill opinion of me, how is it poſſible
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:177519:177"/>
you ſhould beleeue that I haue loued you, and that now I loue you no more? For Gods ſake haue pitty on my fortune, and conſpire not with her to encreaſe my ſorrow: conſider what ſmall likelihood there is, that <hi>Celion,</hi> whom I loue aboue the reſt of the world, and whoſe life pleaſes me as much as mine owne, may bee changed for an <hi>Ergaste,</hi> who is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to me, and in whoſe place I chooſe rather to eſpouſe my tombe; that if I be forced, it is the commandement of my Father, whom my ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour will not ſuffer me to contradict. But is it poſſible you ſhould not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the proteſtations I haue ſo often made to you, that I would not marry my ſelfe? And you ceaſed not to loue mee: whence hath it this change? For, if without marrying me, you haue loued me, why can you not now loue me, without marrying mee, hauing an husband who can for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid mee to haue a brother whom I may alwayes loue with that amity I ought? Good will holds mee neerer to you then is permitted me.

                  <p>While this ſhepheard talked thus with himſelfe, and that he vttered loude enough many words at randon, he was ſo troubled with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after;
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:177519:180"/>
                     <hi>Bellinde,</hi> that had not loſt the remembrance of the appoyntment which ſhe had giuen him, as ſoone as ſhe could free her ſelfe from them about her, went to ſeeke him, ſo much trauelled with ſorrow to loſe him, that ſhe could not hide it, but that it appeared in her countenance. <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> who that morning was riſen in good time to ſee her, by chance perceiued her afar off, and ſeeing her go alone, and (as he thought) ſought out the thickeſt buſhes, had a minde to know whither ſhe went. That was the cauſe, that following her farre off, he ſawe ſhee tooke the way to the fountaine of <hi>Sicomors;</hi> and caſting his eye a little furder off, though it were very earely, he obſerued, that already there was a flocke feeding. Hee that was very aduiſed, and was not ignorant of the affaires of this ſhepheardeſſe, but that he had heard ſpeech of the loue which <hi>Colion</hi> bare her, ſuddenly entred into conceit, that this flocke was his, and that <hi>Bellinde</hi> went to ſeeke him.</p>
                  <p>Now though he made no doubt of the chaſtity of his miſtris, yet did he eaſily beleeue, that ſhee hated him not, thinking that ſo long a ſuite could not haue beene continued if ſhee had miſliked it. And, to ſatisfie his curioſity, as ſoone as he ſawe her vnder the trees, and that ſhe could not ſpie him, fetching a compaſſe ſomevvhat about, hee hid himſelfe among ſome buſhes; where hee perceiued the ſhepheardeſſe ſet on the turffes, which were raiſed about the Fountaine in the faſhion of ſeates, and <hi>Celion</hi> on his knees by her. What an aſſault receiued he at this ſight? Yet, for that hee could not heate what they ſayd, hee went ſoftly, and he came ſo neere them, that there was nothing but an hedge (which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing about the fountaine like a pale) ſhaddowed him. From that place then caſting his eyes betvveene the opening of the leaues, and being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attentiue withall to their diſcourſe, he heard the ſhepheardeſſe anſwer him, And how, <hi>Celion,</hi> is it power or will to pleaſe me, that makes you wanting in this occaſion? Shall this accident haue more force ouer you, than the power you haue giuen me? Where is your courage, <hi>Celion,</hi> or rather, where is your amity? Haue you not heeretofore ouercome for the loue you beare me, greater misfortunes than theſe? If it be ſo, where is the affection, or where is the reſolution that made you doe it? Would you haue me beleeue that you haue leſſe now, than you had then? Ah ſhepheard! conſent thou rather to the ſhortening of my life, than to the leſſening of that goodwill which you haue promiſed me: and as hitherto I haue had that power ouer you that I liſted, ſo for the time to come, let nothing be able to diminiſh the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergaſte</hi> heard that <hi>Celion</hi> anſwered her: Is it poſſible, <hi>Bellinde,</hi> that you
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:177519:180"/>
can enter into doubt of mine affection, and of the power you haue of me Can you haue ſo great a want of vnderſtanding? and can the heauens be ſo vniuſt, that you can forget thoſe teſtimonies which I haue giuen you? and that they haue ſuffered that I ſhould ſuruiue the good opinion which you are to haue of mee? You, <hi>Bellinde,</hi> you may call into queſtion that which neuer any one of my actions, nor of your commaundements left doubtfull: At leaſt, before you take ſo diſaduantagious opinion againſt me, demaund of <hi>Amaranthe,</hi> what ſhe beleeues; demaund the reſpect which makes me ſilent; demaund of <hi>Bellinde</hi> her ſelfe, if euer ſhee ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined any thing difficult, that my affection did not ſurmount.</p>
                  <p>But now that I ſee you entirely anothers, and after the end of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoynted loue, leauing you in the armes of a more happy man than my ſelfe, I muſt be gone, and baniſh my ſelfe for euer from you. Alas, can you ſay it is want of affection, or of will to obey you, if I feele a paine more cruell than that of death? How ſhepheardeſſe! can you thinke I do loue you, if without dying I know you another mans? Will you ſay, it ſhould be loue and courage that make me inſenſible of this diſaſter? ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in truth, ſhall it not be neither loue nor courage to ſuffer this with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpaire? O ſhepheardeſſe! oh that you and I ſhall be a Fable a long while! for if this weaknes, which makes me vnable to liue, and ſupport this misfortune, makes you doubt of my affection; on the contrary, that great conſtancy, and that extreme reſolution, which I ſee in you, is to me an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer-certaine aſſurance of your ſmall amity. But withall, why muſt I hope more of you, when another (O the cruelty of my deſtiny!) is to enioy you? At this word the poore ſhepheard fell on the knees of <hi>Bellinde</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtrength, or ſence.</p>
                  <p>If the ſhepheardeſſe were touched to the quicke, as well at the words, as at the ſwowning of <hi>Celion,</hi> you may iudge (faire Nymph) ſince ſhe lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued him as much as was poſſible; and ſhe muſt diſſemble, that ſhe had no feeling of this dolorous ſeparation. When ſhe ſaw him in a ſwownd, and that ſhe thought ſhe was not heard, but of the <hi>Sicomors,</hi> and the water of the fountaine, vnwilling to hide from them the diſpleaſure which ſhe had kept ſo ſecret from her companions, and thoſe whom ſhe ordinarily ſawe; Alas (ſaid ſhe) wringing her hands! Alas, O ſoueraigne goodneſſe! take me out of this miſery, or out of this life; for pitty, either breake off my cruell diſaſter, or let my cruell diſaſter breake me! And there caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe her eyes on <hi>Celion,</hi> And thou (ſayd ſhe) ouer-faithfull ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, which art not miſerable, but in that thou loueſt miſerable me, let the heauens be pleaſed, either to giue thee the contentments thou deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uedſt,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:177519:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
or to take me from the world, ſince I am the only cauſe that thou ſuffereſt the diſpleaſures which thou meriteſt not. And then holding her peace a while, ſhe beganne againe, O how hard a thing it is to loue well, and to be wiſe withall? For I ſee well, my father hath reaſon to giue mee to the wiſe <hi>Ergaste,</hi> whether for his merits, or for his ſubſtance. But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! what doth this knowledge auaile me, if Loue forbid mine affection to delight in him?</p>
                  <p>I know that <hi>Ergaſte</hi> merits more, and I can hope for nothing more to my benefit than to be his. But how can I giue my ſelfe to him, if Loue haue already giuen mee to another? Reaſon is on my fathers ſide, but Loue is for me; and not a loue lately borne, or that hath no power, but a Loue which I haue conceiued, or rather, which the heauens haue cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be borne with me, which grew vp with me from my cradle, and which by ſo long tract of time is ſo inſinuated into my ſoule, that it is more my ſoule than my ſoule. O God! can I hope to put it off without loſſe of life? And if I cannot vndoe it, tell me, <hi>Bellinde,</hi> what will become of thee? In bringing out theſe words, the great teares fel from her eyes, and running downe along her face, wet both the hand and cheeke of the ſhepheard, who by little and little comming to himſelfe, cauſed the ſhepheardeſſe to breake off her complaints, and wiping her eyes for feare leſt hee ſhould marke it, changing both her countenance, and voyce, ſhe ſpake to him in this ſort, Shepheard, I will confeſſe that I haue a feeling of your paine, (it may be) as much as your ſelfe, and that I cannot doubt of your goodwill, vnleſſe I were the moſt miſ-vnderſtanding perſon in the world.</p>
                  <p>But, to what end ſerue this acknowledgement, and thoſe feelings? ſince the heauens haue ſubiected me to him, that hath giuen mee being, would you haue me ſo to be, that I diſobey him? But be it, that affection more ſtrong preuaile aboue duty, ſhall we therefore, <hi>Celion,</hi> be at reſt? Is it poſſible, if you loue me, that you can haue any contentment to ſee me all the reſt of my life long full of diſpleaſures and griefes? And can you thinke that the blame which I ſhall incurre, whether for diſobeying my father, or for the opinion that euery one ſhall haue of our life paſſed, to my diſaduantage, can leaue me one moment of quie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

It may be, this will be more credible of another than of me, that haue alwayes ſo bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them that haue carried themſelues thus, that the ſhame to ſee my ſelfe falne into their fault, will be more inſupportable to me, than the moſt cruell death which the heauens may ordaine.

                  <p>Now it is certaine, that my father hath giuen me to <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> and that gift can neuer be reuoked, but by <hi>Ergaſte</hi> himſelfe. Iudge you what hope wee can haue euer that will be. It is true, that hauing diſpoſed of my affection before my father did of me, I promiſed and ſwore to you, before all the gods, and particularly, before the deities which dwell in this place, that for affection I would be yours, vntil I were in my tombe: &amp; that there was neither father nor husband, nor tyranny of duty ſhould euer make me doe againſt the oath which I haue made you. The heauens haue giuen me to a father, that father hath giuen my body to an husband. As I may not contradict heau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, ſo my duty forbids me to refuſe the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poyntment of my father. But, neither the heauens, nor my father, nor my husband ſhall euer keep me from hauing a brother, whom I will loue, as I haue promiſed him, whatſoeuer may come of it. At theſe laſt words, foreſeeing that <hi>Celion</hi> would fal againe to plaints and teares; to put it off, ſhe roſe, and taking him by the head, kiſſed his brow, and bidding him farewell, and going away: Shepheard, God grant thee as much content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (ſaid ſhe) in thy iourney, as thou leaueſt me little in the caſe I am in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Celion</hi> had neither the ſtrength to anſwer her, nor the courage to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low her; but being riſen, and holding his armes acroſſe, he went, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying her with his eyes, as farre as he could ſee her; and when the trees tooke away his view, lifting vp his eyes to heauen, all laden with teares, after many great ſighs, he ranne away on the other ſide, without care, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his flocke, or of any thing he left in his cabbin. <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> who lay hid behinde the buſh, and had heard their diſcourſe, was more ſatisfied with the vertue of <hi>Bellinde,</hi> than hee could expreſſe, admiring both the force of her courage, and the greatnes of her honeſty. And after he had long ſtayed, rauiſhed with this thought, conſidering the extreme affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that was betweene theſe two louers, hee beleeued that it would be an act vnworthy himſelfe, to be cauſe of their ſeparation, and that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens had ordained him to meet with that farewell ſo fitly, but to let him ſee the great errour which he went about to commit vnawares. Being then reſolued to worke for their contentment, all he could poſſibly, hee ſet himſelfe to follow <hi>Celion,</hi> but he was by this time ſo farre gone, that he knew not how to ouertake him and thinking to find him in his cabbin,
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:177519:182"/>
he tooke a narrow path that led directly to it. But <hi>Celion</hi> was gone a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way: for without ſpeaking to any of his kinred or friends, he went wandring many dayes, without any other purpoſe than to flie from men, and fed on the wilde fruits which extreme hunger enforced him to gather in the woods. <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> that ſawe his purpoſe was broken on that ſide, after a day or two's ſearch, went to finde out <hi>Bellinde,</hi> hoping to know of her, what way he had taken: and by chance, he found her at the ſame place, where ſhe had bid <hi>Celion</hi> adieu, all alone on the ſide of the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, at that time meditating on the laſt accident that befell her in that place; the remembrance whereof brought teares from the depth of her heart. <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> that ſawe her long before, came purpoſely to take her in the moſt priuate ſort hee could poſſibly: and ſeeing her teares like two Springs, runne downe into the Fountaine, he had ſo much pitty, that he ſwore, not to take a good nights ſlee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>, vntill hee had remedied her diſpleaſure. And to loſe no time, aduauncing himſelfe at once towards her, he ſaluted her.</p>
                  <p>Shee that ſawe her ſelfe ouertaken with teares in her eyes, that ſhee might hide them, making ſhew to waſh her ſelfe, and nimbly caſting her hands into the water, wet her face all ouer, ſo that if <hi>Ergaſte</hi> had not ſeene her teares before, he could hardly haue knowne ſhe wept: which yet made him more to wonder at her vertue. At that time ſhe painted in her face a ſmiling countenance, and turning to the ſhepheard, ſaid to him, with a faſhion of courteſie, I thought to haue beene a lone (gentle ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard) but for that I ſee you are come for the ſame cauſe (as I thinke) that brought me hither, I would ſay, to refreſh you, and without fayning, ſee the beſt Spring, and the moſt freſh that is in this Plaine. Wiſe and faire ſhepheardeſſe (anſwered <hi>Ergaſte</hi> ſmiling) you haue reaſon to ſay, that the ſame cauſe; which made you come hither, hath likewiſe brought me. For it is true; but where you ſay, that you and I come to refreſh our ſelues, I muſt contradict it, for that neither of vs had it for our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. For my part, ſaid the ſhepheardeſſe, I confeſſe I may be deceiued for you: but for mine owne particular, you muſt permit me to ſay, that there is none that knowes more than my ſelfe. I grant (ſayd <hi>Ergaſte)</hi> that you know more than all others. But you ſhall not therefore make mee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, that the cauſe that brought you hither, is the very ſame you haue ſpoken of.</p>
                  <p>And what thinke you then (ſayd ſhe) it was? At this word ſhe laid her hand on her face, ſeeming to rubbe her eye-browes, but, indeede, to hide (in ſome ſort) the redneſſe which was riſen. Which <hi>Ergaſte</hi> mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:177519:182"/>
and willing to free her of the paine wherein hee ſawe her, anſwered thus: Faire and diſcreet ſhepheardeſſe, you muſt vſe no more diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation with mee, that know as well as you, that which you do thinke you haue moſt ſecret in your ſoule: and to manifeſt vnto you that I lie not, I tell you, that at this preſent, you are heere at this waters ſide, thinking with great diſpleaſure on the laſt adieu, which you gaue vnto <hi>Celion</hi> in this place where you are. I (ſayd ſhee) preſently all ouertaken? Yes, you (ſaid <hi>Ergaſte:)</hi> but be not greeued that I know it. For I doe ſo eſteeme of your vertue and worth, that it ſhall be ſo farre from hurting you, that I deſire it ſhould be the cauſe of your contentment. I know the long ſeruice which this ſhepheard hath done you: I know with how much honour hee hath wooed you. I know with what affection he hath continued theſe many yeeres: and moreouer, with what ſincere and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous amity you haue affected him.</p>
                  <p>The knowledge of all theſe things makes me deſire death, rather than to be the cauſe of your ſeparation. Thinke not that it is Ielouſie that cauſeth mee to ſpeake in this manner: I ſhall neuer enter into any doubt of your vertue, ſince I haue heard with mine eares the wiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which you haue had with him. No more thinke you, but that I beleeue, that loſing you, I ſhall likewiſe loſe the beſt fortune that I could wiſh for: but the onely cauſe that driueth mee to giue you to him, whoſe you ought to be, is this (O wiſe <hi>Bellinde)</hi> that I will not buy my contentment with your euerlaſting diſpleaſure: and truely, I ſhould thinke my ſelfe to be culpable both before God and men, if by my oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, ſo good and vertuous an amity ſhould be broken off betvveene you.</p>
                  <p>I therefore come to tell you, that I chooſe rather to depriue my ſelfe of the beſt alliance that euer I ſhall haue, to ſet you in your former liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to giue you backe againe the contentment which mine would haue taken from you. And beſides that, I thinke to do and performe that which I beleeue my duetie commaundeth me; it ſhall be no ſmall ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to me, to thinke, that if <hi>Bellinde</hi> be contented, <hi>Ergaſte</hi> was an inſtrument of her contentment. Onely I doe require, that if heerein I binde you being the cauſe of the re-vnion of your amity, you will be pleaſed to receiue mee as a third to you two, and that you will yeeld mee the ſame part of goodwill, which you promiſed to <hi>Celion,</hi> when you did thinke to marry <hi>Ergaſte:</hi> I meane, that I may be a friend to you two, and be receiued as a brother.</p>

Can I (faire Nymph) ſhew you the contentment vnhoped for of this ſhepheardeſſe? I thinke it is impoſſible: for ſhe was ſo ſurprized, that ſhe knew not with what words to thanke him: but taking him by the hand, ſhe went to ſit downe on the turfes of the fountaine; where, after ſhe had pauſed a while, and ſeeing the good will wherewith <hi>Ergaſte</hi> bound her, ſhe declared all along, what had paſſed betweene <hi>Celion</hi> and her, and after a thouſand kinds of thankes, which I omit, for ſeare of troubling you, ſhe beſought him to goe ſeeke him, for that the tranſport of <hi>Celion</hi> was ſuch, that hee would not come backe with any man in the world that ſhould ſeeke him, for that he would neuer beleeue that good will of his, whom he had neuer giuen ſuch cauſe to, if it were aſſured him by any other: But on the contrary, he would imagine it were a trick to bring him backe. <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſte,</hi> that deſired in any caſe to end the good worke he had begunne, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to be gone the nextday, with <hi>Diamis</hi> the brother of <hi>Celion,</hi> promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her not to come backe without bringing him with him.</p>
                  <p>Beeing then departed with this purpoſe, after hee had ſacrificed to <hi>Thautates,</hi> to deſire him to direct them to the place where they might find <hi>Celion,</hi> they tooke the way that firſt offered it ſelfe to them. But they had ſought long in vaine, before they had any newes, if himſelfe, tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with fury, had not reſolued to returne into <hi>Forreſts,</hi> to kill <hi>Ergaste,</hi> and then with the ſame weapon to pierce his owne heart, before <hi>Bellinde,</hi> not being able to liue and know that another enioyed his good. In this rage hee ſet himſelfe on his way: and becauſe hee nouriſhed himſelfe but with hearbes and fruits, which hee found along the way, hee was ſo feeble, that he could ſcarce goe: and had not his rage carried him, hee could not haue done that; yet muſt he diuers times of the day reſt him, eſpecially when ſleepe preſſed him.</p>
                  <p>It fell out, that wearied in this ſort, hee lay downe vnder ſome trees which gaue a pleaſing ſhadow to a Fountaine, &amp; there, after he had ſome while thought of his diſpleaſures, he fell aſleep. Here Fortune, who deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her ſelfe with the griefes ſhee had wrought him, diſpoſes to make him intirely happy. <hi>Ergaſte</hi> and <hi>Diamis</hi> paſſed by this way, and by chance <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> went firſt: on the ſudden when he ſaw him, he knew him, and turning ſoftly, came, to aduertiſe <hi>Ergaste,</hi> who very ioyfull, would haue gone to embrace him, but <hi>Diamis</hi> held him backe, ſaying, I beſeech you, <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> doe nothing herein that may turne to euill: my brother, if at once wee ſhould tell him this good newes, would dye with ioy; and if you knewe the extreme affliction that this accident hath brought him, you would be of the ſame minde. Therefore, me thinkes, it will bee better that I tell it

him by little and little, and becauſe hee will not beleeue me, you may come after to confirme it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergaſte</hi> finding this aduice good, got behind ſome trees where he might ſee them, and <hi>Dianis</hi> went to him. And it muſt needes be, that he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by ſome good Angell: for if at the firſt <hi>Celion</hi> had ſpyed <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> it may be, that following his reſolution, he had done him ſome diſpleaſure.

<hi>Celion</hi> hearing theſe newes, ſtood without anſwer, almoſt beſides himſelfe; and then ſpeaking againe, You deceiue your ſelfe, brother, ſayd he, or ſay you this to abuſe me?

But when he knew the truth of this affaire, hee caſt himſelfe on his knees before <hi>Ergaſte,</hi> and would haue kiſſed his feet.

And ſome yeeres after, they had a daughter, named <hi>Diane:</hi> but <hi>Celion</hi> nor <hi>Ergaſte</hi> had not long the pleaſure of this childe, becauſe they dyed ſhortly after, and both on one day: and this is <hi>Diane,</hi> of whom you asked me newes, and who is accounted in our Hamlet, for one of the fayreſt and wiſeſt ſhepheardeſſes in all <hi>Forestes.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ELADON</hi> went on in this ſort, telling to the Nymph the hiſtory of <hi>Colion</hi> and <hi>Belinde,</hi> while <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Galathee</hi> talked of the newes which <hi>Flurial</hi> brought them: for as ſoone as the Nymph perceiued <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſhe tooke her aſide, and bid her take heede, that <hi>Flurial</hi> ſaw not <hi>Celadon;</hi> for (ſaid ſhe) he is ſo intirely for <hi>Lindamor,</hi> that the beaſt wil tell him all he ſees: entertaine him then, and when I haue looked o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer my Letters, I will tell you what newes I haue. At this word, the Nymph went out of the chamber, and led <hi>Flurial</hi> with her, and after ſome other ſpeeches, ſhee ſaid to him: Well <hi>Flurial,</hi> what newes bring you to my Lady? Very good, anſwered he, and ſuch as ſhe and you would wiſh; for <hi>Clidaman</hi> is well, and <hi>Lindamor</hi> hath done ſuch wonders in the battaile, that it is found, that <hi>Meroue</hi> and <hi>Childerick</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme of him as his vertue deſerues: but there is a young man with me, that would ſpeake with <hi>Siluy,</hi> whom they at the Gate would not ſuffer to enter, who will tell you much better all the particulars, for that he came from thence; and I receiued theſe Letters at my Aunts, whither one of <hi>Lindamors</hi> followers brought them, and expects an anſwer. And knoweſt thou not, replyed the Nymph, what he would ſay to <hi>Siluy?</hi> No, anſwered he, for he would neuer tell it: Hee muſt (ſaid the Nymph) come in. At this word going toward the Gate, ſhe knew the Youth preſently, for ſhe had ſeene him oft with <hi>Ligda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> which made her iudge, he brought ſome newes to <hi>Siluy:</hi> And becauſe ſhe knew well, that her ſiſter deſired theſe affaires might be

ſecret, ſhe would aske him nothing, fayning not to know him; onely ſhe told him, ſhe would aduertiſe <hi>Siluy</hi> of it. Then drawing <hi>Flurial</hi> aſide: Thou knoweſt well <hi>Flurial,</hi> ſaid ſhe (my friend) the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune that is befalne <hi>Lindamor.</hi> How, anſwered <hi>Flurial?</hi> we ſhould rather thinke him happy: for he hath got ſuch glory where he is, that at his returne, <hi>Amaſis</hi> dares not deny him <hi>Galathee.</hi> O <hi>Flurial,</hi> what ſayſt thou? If thou knewſt how things haue paſſed here, thou wouldſt proteſt, that the voyage of our friend is for his part the way of death. O God (ſaid he) what ſay you? for I doubt not, but at his returne he will dye of ſorrow. <hi>Flurial</hi> (ſaid ſhe) it is as I tell thee, and beleeue not, that there is any remedy, vnleſſe it come from thee. From me, ſaid he? if it may come from me, hold it for moſt certaine, for there is nothing in the world that I will not doe. Now, ſaid the Nymph, you muſt then be ſecret, and this euening I will tell you more: but now I muſt know what the poore abſent man writes.

               <p>I care not then, ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> neyther for him nor his victories; he ſhall bind me, more to forget me. For Gods ſake (ſaid <hi>Leonide)</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame ſay not ſo: if you knew how well he is eſteemed both by <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roue</hi> and <hi>Childerick,</hi> I cannot beleeue (being borne as you are) but you will make more of him then of a Shepheard, I ſay a Shepheard that loues you not, and whom you ſee ſighing before you for the affection of a Shepheardeſſe. You may thinke, that all that I ſpeake, is out of cunning. It is true, preſently anſwered <hi>Galathee.</hi> Well Madame, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> you may beleeue what pleaſeth you, but I ſweare vnto you by all that may be moſt fearefull to the periured, That in this iourney by great chance I ſaw that Impoſtor <hi>Clemanthe,</hi> and that cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Polymas,</hi> talking of what happened to you, and diſcouering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them all the tricks they had vſed. <hi>Leonide</hi> (added <hi>Galathee)</hi> you loſe time, I am reſolued what I will doe, talke no more to me of it. I will doe Madame what you command, ſaid ſhe; but ſuffer me to ſay one word: What doe you meane to doe with this Shepheard? I will haue him loue me, ſaid ſhe. Wherein, replyed <hi>Leonide,</hi> purpoſe you that this amitie ſhall be concluded. You are ouer-buſie, ſaid <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathee,</hi> to wiſh me to know the things to come; only let him loue me, and then we will ſee what we haue to doe. Yet (continued <hi>Leonide)</hi> though one know not what will happen, yet in all our deſignes, wee muſt haue ſome Butt whereto wee may ayme. I thinke in all, ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> except thoſe of loue: and for my part, I will haue no other deſigne, but that he loue me. Then replyed <hi>Leonide,</hi> it muſt be ſo,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:177519:187"/>
for there is no likelyhood that you will marry him; and not marrying him, what will become of that honour which you haue preſerued to your ſelfe? for it cannot be, that this new loue can blind you ſo, but that you will find the wrong you doe to your ſelfe, to wiſh for your louer the man whom you would not marry. And you (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onide,</hi> that are ſo ſcrupulous, tell me true, are you enuious that I ſhould marry him? I, Madame, anſwered ſhe, I hold him to be too meane a thing, and I humbly beſeech you, not to thinke me of ſo ſmall courage, that I will dayne to caſt mine eye on him. And if euer there were any man that had the power to giue me feeling of loue, I freely proteſt to you, the reſpect which I haue borne you, hath made me withdraw. When was that, added <hi>Galathee?</hi> Then, ſaid ſhee, when you commanded me (Madame) to make no more of <hi>Polemas.</hi> O what grace you haue (cryed <hi>Galathee?)</hi> by your faith did you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer loue <hi>Celadon?</hi> I will ſweare vnto you by the faith I owe to you, Madame, anſwered ſhe, that I neuer loued <hi>Celadon</hi> otherwiſe, then as if he had beene my brother. And in that ſhe lyed not: for after the ſhepheard ſpake ſo plainely to her at the laſt time, ſhe found out the wrong ſhe did to her ſelfe, and ſo reſolued to change the loue into amitie, Well <hi>Leonide,</hi> ſaid the Nymph, let vs leaue this diſcourſe, and that likewiſe of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> for the Dye is caſt. And what anſwer, ſaid ſhe, will you make to <hi>Lindamor?</hi> I will make him, ſaid ſhe, no other, but by ſilence. And what thinke you, ſaid ſhe, will become of him, when the man hee ſent, returnes without Letters? Let what may, ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> become of him; for, for my part; neyther his reſolution nor any others, ſhall euer be cauſe for me to make my ſelfe miſerable. Is it not then neceſſarie, anſwered <hi>Leonide,</hi> that <hi>Flurial</hi> goe backe? No, ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Leonide</hi> then told her coldly, that there was a young man that would ſpeake with <hi>Siluy,</hi> and that ſhee beleeued hee was come from <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and he would not tell his meſſage but onely to <hi>Siluy</hi> her ſelfe. We muſt, anſwered the Nymph, ſend him where. ſhee is: wee muſt not thinke much to draw the Curtaynes of the Bed where <hi>Celadon</hi> lyes, for I aſſure my ſelfe, hee will be glad to heare what <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath written; for me thinkes you haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie told him all their loues. It is true, anſwered <hi>Leonide:</hi> but <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy</hi> is ſo diſdainefull, and ſo loftie, that without doubt ſhe would be offended, that the meſſenger ſhould ſpeake to her, eſpecially before <hi>Celadon.</hi> Wee muſt, ſaid ſhee, take her on the ſuddaine: Onely
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:177519:187"/>
goe before, and will the ſhepheard not to ſpeake a word, and draw the Curtaynes, and I will bring him in. So parted theſe Nymphs.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Galathee</hi> knowing the young man, as hauing often ſeene him with <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> demaunded whence hee came, and what newes hee brought from his Maſter. I come Madame, ſaid hee, from the Armie of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Madame, ſaid hee, it ſhall be before you, if it pleaſe you, for I haue that commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and principally, before <hi>Leonide.</hi> Come then (ſaid the Nymph) and ſo ſhee brought him into the Chamber of <hi>Celadon:</hi> where alreadie <hi>Leonide</hi> had giuen the order as ſhe had appointed, without ſaying any thing to <hi>Siluy;</hi> who at the firſt was aſtonied, but afterward ſeeing <hi>Galathee</hi> enter with this young man, ſhee iudged, that it was to keepe the ſhepheard from being ſeene, The amazement ſhee found was great, when ſhee ſaw <hi>Egide</hi> (that was the young mans Name) whome ſhee knew preſently: for though ſhee had no loue for <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> yet ſhee could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt her ſelfe from all kind of good will; ſhee iudged rightly, that hee would tell her ſome newes, but ſhee would not aske him.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Galathee</hi> turning to the young man, ſaid: See where <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy</hi> is; you haue no more to doe, but to goe through with your Meſſage, ſince you deſire that <hi>Leonide</hi> and I ſhould be by. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame (ſaid <hi>Egide,</hi> turning to <hi>Siluy)</hi> my Maſter, the moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſeruant that your merits euer wonne you, hath commaunded me to let you know what his fortune hath beene; wiſhing no other thing from Heauen, as a recompence of his fidelitie, but that one ſparke of pittie may touch you, ſince none of loue could come neere the yee of your heart. How now (ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his ſpeech) it ſeemes hee hath made his Teſtament: how doth hee? Madame (ſaid hee, turning to <hi>Galathee)</hi> I will tell you, if it pleaſe you to giue me the leyſure: and then turning to <hi>Siluy,</hi> hee went on in this ſort.</p>

                     <hi>The Hiſtorie of</hi> Ligdamon.</head>
                  <p>AFter <hi>Ligdamon</hi> had taken leaue of you, hee went with <hi>Lindamor,</hi> accompanied with ſo many goodly deſignes, that hee promiſed himſelfe no leſſe then to winne by this voyage that which his ſeruices could not by his preſence, reſoluing to doe ſo many famous acts, that whether the name of valiant, which his victories gaue him, might be pleaſing vnto you, or well dying, he might leaue you to ſorrow. With this deſigne he came into the Army of <hi>Meroue,</hi> a Prince filled with all perfections which are neceſſary to a Conqueror, and arriued ſo luckily, that the battaile was aſſigned the ſeuenth day after; ſo that all the young Knights had no other greater care, then to viſite their Armes, and to put their Horſes into good plight. But it is not of them that I am to ſpeake: Therefore letting paſſe all vnder ſilence which touches not <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> I will tell you, that the day aſſigned for this great fight being come, the two Armies came out of their Campe, and had ſight the one of the other, ſetting themſelues in battaile array; here a ſquadron of Horſemen, there a battalion of Footmen; here the Drums, there the Trumpets: on the one ſide, the neighing of Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, on the other, the voice of Souldiers rayſed ſuch a noyſe, that one might well ſay, that <hi>Bellona</hi> the dreadfull was towling in this Playne, and that ſhe had brought forth whatſoeuer was moſt horrible in her <hi>Gorgon.</hi> For my part, I (who was neuer in the like occaſion) was ſo deaffed with that I heard, and ſo dazled with the brightneſſe of the armour, that indeede I knew not where I was; yet my reſolution was not to leaue my Maſter: for the bringing me vp from my child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, me thought bound me to it, and not to goe farre from him in this occaſion, where nothing was preſented to our eyes, but with the enſignes of death. But this was nothing to the ſtrange confuſion, when all theſe ſquadrons and all theſe battailons met together, when the ſigne of battaile was giuen: for the Horſemen ſet on the enemy, and the Infanterie likewiſe, with ſo great a noyſe which the Men, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and Horſes made, that one could not heare it thunder.</p>
                  <p>After there had paſſed many clouds of arrowes, I cannot tell you true how I found my ſelfe with my Maſter in the middeſt of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, that I could not but admire the great gaſhes of <hi>Ligdamons</hi> Sword: and without fayning, faire Nymph, I ſaw him doe ſuch mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes, that one made me forget the other. So it was, that his valour
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:177519:188"/>
was ſuch, that <hi>Meroue</hi> would know his name, as hauing noted him that day among all the other Knights.</p>
                  <p>By this time the former Squadron grew victorious, and our men began to order themſelues to ſet on the ſecond; when the enemie, to make vp one entire puſh, cauſed all his forces that remayned, to march forward, that he might with that ſpeed infeſt them, before <hi>Meroue</hi> ſhould be able to ſuccour them in time. And indeed, if he had had to doe with a Captaine leſſe experienced then him, I thinke his purpoſe had taken effect. But this great Souldier iudging the deſpayre of the Aduerſary, at the ſame time diuided three new Squadrons, two to the two Wings, and the third in the tayle of the former, ſo fitly, that they ſuſtayned a great part of the firſt ſhocke; yet wee who were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced forwardeſt, found our ſelues much ouer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> layd with great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. But I will not now trouble you with a particular deſcription of this dayes worke, and I know not how to bring it about. So it was, that then the two bodies of the footmen being encountred, that of <hi>Meroue</hi> had the better, and as much as we gayned of ground of them on horſeback, ſo much loſt the Infanterie of the enemie. At the ſhock which we receiued, there were many of ours borne to the ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe whom the arrowes of the Infanterie, from the beginning of the battaile, had vnhorſed: for at the meeting, the enemy cauſing ſome Archers to ſhoot off, made vs draw through the Wings ſo many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, that our horſemen not daring to leaue their rankes, had much adoe to beare them, before <hi>Meroue</hi> had ſent ſome of his to skirmiſh with them. And among thoſe that at the ſecond brunt were put to the worſe, <hi>Clidaman</hi> was one, for his horſe fell downe dead, by three wounds of three arrowes. <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that had alwayes his eyes on him, ſuddenly, ſeeing him on the earth, ſpurred his horſe in extreme furie, and did ſuch deedes of armes, that he made a Round of dead bodies about <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who in the meane time had leyſure to free himſelfe from his horſe. The furie of the enemie, which by this fall of <hi>Clida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> was renewed in that place, had at laſt trode him vnder the horſes feet, but for the helpe and valour of my Maſter, who allighting, ſet him on his owne horſe, ſtaying on foot ſo wounded and ſo charged with the enemie, that he could not mount on the horſe that I brought him. At this inſtant, our men were forced to giue backe, as feeling their weakneſſe, as I thinke by the inuincible arme of my Maſter; and the miſchiefe was ſo great for vs, that we found our ſelues in the midſt of ſo many enemies, that there was no more hope of ſafety: Yet would
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:177519:189"/>
neuer <hi>Ligdamon</hi> yeeld himſelfe, though hee were ſo wounded and ſo wearied as may be imagined; yet was there none ſo hardy, ſeeing what gaſhes hee gaue with his arme, that durſt lay hold on him. At laſt, with all the furie of their horſe fiue or ſix came to ſtrike him, and ſo ſuddenly, that hauing beſtowed his Sword in the belly of the firſt horſe, it brake neere the hilt, and the horſe ſtrucken to the heart, fell downe vpon him. I ranne to helpe him vp; but tenne or twelue that caſt themſelues on him, hindered me: and ſo both of vs halfe dead, were rayſed vp.</p>
                  <p>And this accident was yet more vnfortunate, in that, that almoſt at the ſame time our men recouered the ground they had loſt, by the ſuccours which <hi>Childerick</hi> brought from the rereward, and after went on gayning the field, vntill it was wholly gotten at euening, and the lodgings of the enemie burnt, and themſelues for the moſt part ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or ſlaine. As for vs, we were carried to their principall Towne, called <hi>Roan:</hi> whither my Maſter was no ſooner come, but many came to viſit him; ſome of them calling themſelues his kinſmen, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his friends, though hee knew them not. For my part, I knew not what to ſay, not he to thinke, when he ſaw thoſe ſtrangers make ſo much of him: but we were more aſtonied, when an honourable Lady, well followed, came to viſit him, ſaying, that he was her ſonne, with ſuch demonſtration of amitie, that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was like one beſides himſelfe; and much more, when ſhe ſaid to him: O <hi>Lidias,</hi> my child, with what contentment and feare doe I ſee thee here? for I thanke God, that at the end of my dayes I ſee thee ſo much eſteemed of by the report of them that haue taken thee: but alas, what is my feare, to ſee thee in this cruell Towne, ſince thy enemy <hi>Aronte</hi> is dead of the wounds which he had of thee, and that thou haſt beene condemned to death by the Lords, of Iuſtice? for my part, I know no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie, but to ranſome thee preſently, and lye cloſe till thou beeſt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, that being able to mount on horſebacke, thou mayeſt bee gone with the <hi>Franks.</hi> If <hi>Ligdamon</hi> were aſtonied at this diſcourſe, you may iudge, and then knew well ſhe tooke him for another. But hee could not anſwer her, becauſe at the ſame inſtant he which had taken him, entred into the Chamber with two Officers of the Towne, to take the names and qualitie of the priſoners, for there were many of their men taken, and they would exchange them. The poore Lady was ſurprized, fearing they came to carry him to priſon, and hearing they asked him his Name, ſhee was about to tell it her ſelfe, but my
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:177519:189"/>
Maſter thruſt her back, and called himſelfe <hi>Ligdoman</hi> the <hi>Seguſian.</hi> She then had an opinion, he meant to diſſemble; and to put out all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition, ſhe withdrew her ſelfe, with a reſolution to ranſome him with all ſpeed, that he might not be knowne. And it was true, that my Maſter reſembled <hi>Lidias</hi> ſo much, that all that ſaw him, tooke him for him. Now this <hi>Lidias</hi> was a young man of that Countrey, that being in loue with a faire Lady, had fought with <hi>Aronte</hi> his Riuall, whoſe iealouſie was ſuch, that it let him goe beyond his dutie, ſpeaking euill both of her and him. Whereat <hi>Lidias</hi> offended, after hee had ſpoken twice or thrice to make him change his diſcourſe, and thinking, that he tooke it as out of feare, which indeed proceeded from the wiſdome of the young man, he was at laſt enforced both out of duty and loue to come to Armes, and with that happineſſe, that hauing left his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie as dead on the earth, he had the leyſure to ſaue himſelfe from the hands of Iuſtice; which, after that <hi>Aronte</hi> was dead purſued him ſo, that though he were abſent, yet they condemned him to death. <hi>Ligda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> was ſo wounded, that he dreamt not of theſe things: I, that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the euill that might befall him, alwayes preſſed his mother to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme him; which ſhe did, but not ſo ſecretly, but that the enemies of <hi>Lidias</hi> were aduertiſed of it: ſo that at their requeſt, the ſame day the good Lady hauing payed the ranſome, and carrying him to her houſe, thoſe Officers of Iuſtice came vpon them, and made him take the way to priſon, whatſoeuer <hi>Ligdamon</hi> could ſay; deceiued like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, by the reſemblance of <hi>Lidias.</hi> So behold him in as great danger as a man might be, that had not offended. But this was nothing to the next dayes worke; when hee was queſtioned of points whereof he was ſo ignorant, that he knew not what to ſay: Notwithſtanding, they forbore not to ratifie the former Iudgement, and gaue him no further terme, then to the healing of his wounds.</p>
                  <p>The bruit preſently ran throughout all the Towne, that <hi>Lidias</hi> was priſoner, and that he was condemned to dye, not as a Murderer only, but as a Rebell, hauing beene taken with Armes in his hand for the <hi>Franks,</hi> that for this cauſe he was to be put into the Cage of the Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and it was true, that their cuſtome was ſuch: but they would not pronounce this award to him, that he might not make himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. Yet they talked of no other thing within the Towne: and the voyce was ſo ſpred, that it came to my eares. Wherewith being fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, I diſguiſed my ſelfe ſo, with the helpe of this good Lady which had redeemed him, that I came to <hi>Paris,</hi> to find out <hi>Meroue</hi> and <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daman,</hi>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:177519:190"/>
whom I gaue to vnderſtand of this accident: whereat they were much aſtonied, thinking it almoſt impoſſible, that two men ſhould be ſo alike, that there might be no difference. And to remedy it, they ſent ſpeedily two Heralds of Armes, to let the enemies know the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror wherein they were: but this ſerued but to perſwade them the more, and to make them haſten the execution of their Iudgement.</p>
                  <p>The wounds of <hi>Ligdamon</hi> were almoſt healed; ſo that to giue him no longer time, they pronounced the Sentence, That attainted of Murder and Rebellion, Iuſtice had ordayned that hee ſhould dye by the Lyons, appointed to ſuch an execution: yet becauſe hee was nobly borne, and their countreyman, they did him the grace, to ſuffer him to carry his Sword and Dagger, as being the Armes of a Knight, wherewith if he had the courage, he might defend himſelfe, or at leaſt aſſay generouſly to reuenge his death. And at this time in their Councell they made an anſwer to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>roue,</hi> That ſo they would cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtife all their countreymen that were traytors to their Countrey. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the poore <hi>Ligdamon</hi> in extreme danger: yet that courage which yet neuer bended but vnder loue, ſeeing there was no other remedy, reſolued to looke to his owne ſafetie the beſt he could. And becauſe <hi>Lidias</hi> was one of the better Families among the <hi>Normans,</hi> almoſt all the people aſſembled to ſee this Spectacle. And when hee ſaw they were ready to put him into this horrible cloſe field, all that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, was, that hee might fight with the Lyons one by one. The people hearing ſo iuſt a demaund, agreed to it by their acclamations and clapping of hands, what difficulties ſoeuer the contrary part propounded. So that behold him thruſt alone into the Cage: and the Lyons on the other ſide the barres ſeeing this new prey, roared ſo fearefully, that there was none of the ſtanders by that trembled not. Without more, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> ſeemed confident among ſo many dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and hauing an eye on the firſt Gate that was to open, leſt hee might be ſurprized, hee ſaw a furious Lyon come forth with ſtaring looke, and hauing three or foure times ſtrucken the earth with his tayle, began to thruſt forth his great fore-feet, and to open his pawes, as if hee would ſhew him what death hee was to die. But <hi>Ligdamon</hi> ſeeing well there was no ſafetie but in his valour, as ſoone as hee ſaw him riſe vp, he caſt his ponyard ſo fitly at him, that he planted it in his ſtomacke euen to the haft, wherewith the Beaſt being touched at the heart, fell downe dead preſently. The cry of the people was great; for euery one being mooued with his confidence, with his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:177519:190"/>
valour, and with his courage, fauoured him in his ſoule: but hee that knew well that the rigour of his Iudges would not ſtay there, ran rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to take againe his ponyard; and almoſt at the ſame time, ſee ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lyon, no leſſe fearefull then the former, that as ſoone as the Gate was opened, came with open throat in ſuch furie, that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was almoſt ſurprized: yet as he paſſed, he turned himſelfe a little aſide, and with his Sword gaue him ſuch a blow vpon one of his pawes, that he cut it off, whereat the Beaſt in furie ſo ſuddenly came on him, that he caſt him to the ground, but his fortune was ſuch, that in falling, and the Lyon ramping ouer him, he could but hold out his Sword, which fell out ſo luckily to be vnder his belly, that he fell downe dead almoſt as ſoone as the former.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> was diſputing for his life, behold a Lady faire among the <hi>Normans,</hi> that caſt her ſelfe on her knees before the Iudges, beſeeching them to cauſe the execution to ceaſe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till ſhe had ſpoken. They that knew her to be of the principall of the Countrey, willingly yeelded her that fauour; and indeed it was ſhee for whom <hi>Lidias</hi> had ſlaine <hi>Aronte:</hi> her name was <hi>Ameryne,</hi> and then ſhe ſpake to them in this ſort, with a modeſt voyce.</p>
                  <p>My Lords, Ingratitude is to be puniſhed as Treaſon, becauſe it is a kind of it: Therefore ſeeing <hi>Lidias</hi> condemned for being on the contrary ſide, I feare I ſhould be counted ſo, if not of you, yet of the Gods, if I thought not my ſelfe bound to ſaue his life that hazarded his to ſaue my honour. This is it for which I preſent my ſelfe before you, relying on our priuiledges, which ordaine, That a man condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to death, ſhall be deliuered, when a maid demaunds him for her husband. As ſoone as I knew of your Iudgement, I came with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to require it, and I could not be here ſo ſoone, but he hath run the fortune that all men haue ſeene; yet ſince God hath preſerued him ſo happily for me, you are not iuſtly to deny me.</p>
                  <p>All the people that heard this demaund, cryed with a ioyfull voyce, Grace, Grace. And though the enemies of <hi>Lidias</hi> labored the contrary, yet was it concluded, that the priuiledges of the Countrey ſhould take place. But alas, <hi>Ligdamon</hi> came out of this danger, but to enter into a greater: for being brought before the Iudges, they let him know the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes of the Country were ſuch, That any man attainted &amp; conuicted of any Crime whatſoeuer, might be deliuered from the rigours of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, if a maid demaunded him for husband; ſo that if he would marry <hi>Ameryne,</hi> he ſhould be reſtored to his liberty, and might liue with her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:177519:191"/>
He that knew her not, found it hard to anſwer: notwithſtanding, ſeeing no other remedy to eſcape the danger wherein he was, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it, hoping that time would bring out ſome commoditie to free him out of the Labyrinth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ameryne,</hi> that had alwayes found <hi>Lidias</hi> ſo amorous of her, was not a little aſtonied at this coldneſſe, yet iudging, that the affrightment of the danger wherein hee was, had made him thus beſides himſelfe, ſhee had the more pitty on him, and carried him to <hi>Lidias</hi> mothers houſe, who was ſhe that procured the marriage, knowing, there was no other remedy to ſaue her ſonnes life: beſides that, ſhee was not ignorant of the loue betweene them, which made her preſſe the concluſion of the marriage the moſt that poſſibly ſhee could, thinking to pleaſe her ſonne. But on the contrary, this was to haſten the death of him that could doe no more then he had done. Ah my deare Maſter, when I call to mind the laſt words you ſpake to me, I know not how it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to liue?</p>
                  <p>All things were ready for the marriage, and it muſt be diſpatched the next day, when the night before he tooke me aſide, and ſaid <hi>Egide</hi> my friend, didſt thou euer ſee ſuch a fortune as this, that they will make me beleeue that I am not my ſelfe? Sir, ſaid I, me thinkes it is not euill: <hi>Ameryne</hi> is faire and rich, all that call themſelues her kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are the principall of this Country; what would you deſire more? Ah <hi>Egide,</hi> ſaid he, thou ſpeakeſt for thine owne eaſe. If thou kneweſt the caſe wherein I am, thou wouldſt haue pitty on me. But haue care of what I ſay, and aboue all the Obligation that thou oweſt me, and the loue which I haue alwayes found in thee, fayle not as ſoone as to morrow I ſhall haue done that I am reſolued of, to beare this Letter to the faire <hi>Siluy,</hi> and relate to her all that thou haſt ſeene; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer aſſure her, that I neuer loued any but her, and neuer ſhall. At this word he gaue me this Letter, which I kept very carefully vntill the next morning; when at the houre that he was to goe to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he called me, and commanded me to be about him, and made me ſweare againe to ſeeke you out with diligence. At the ſame time one came to him, to place him in the wedding Chariot, where already the faire <hi>Ameryne</hi> was ſet with one of her vnckles, whom ſhe loued and honoured as her father. She was in the midſt between <hi>Ligdamon</hi> and <hi>Cariſtes,</hi> ſo her vnckle was named, all couered with a yellow vayle, and hauing on her head as well as <hi>Ligdamon</hi> the Garland. It is true, my Maſters was of Sifymber, and <hi>Amerynes</hi> of picked and ſweete
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:177519:191"/>
Aſpharagon. Before the Chariot went all the family; and after, only the kinſmen and neereſt allies and friends. In this Triumph they came to the Temple, and were brought to <hi>Hymens</hi> Altar, before which, fiue Torches were lighted: On the right ſide of <hi>Hymen</hi> they had placed <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Iu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>enus</hi> and <hi>Diana.</hi> As for <hi>Hymen,</hi> he was crowned with flowers and ſweet Marioram, holding in his right hand a Torch, and in his left a Vayle, of that colour that <hi>Amerynes</hi> was, as alſo the buskins which hee had on his feet. When they entred into the Temple, the mother of <hi>Lidias</hi> and <hi>Ameryne</hi> ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their Torches; and then the great <hi>Druide</hi> comming neere, direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his ſpeech to my Maſter, and demaunded: <hi>Lidias,</hi> will you haue <hi>Ameryne</hi> for the mother of your Family? he ſtayed ſomewhile with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out anſwer, at laſt he was conſtrayned to ſay yes. Then the <hi>Druide</hi> turning to her: And you <hi>Ameryne,</hi> will you haue <hi>Lidias</hi> for father of your Family? and ſhee anſwering yes, then taking their hands, and ioyning them together, hee ſaid: And I, in tho behalfe of the great Gods, giue you each to other, and for earneſt, you muſt eat the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition together: and then taking the Wheaten Cake, <hi>Lidias</hi> cut it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to pieces, and ſhee laying them together, of which, according to the cuſtome, they both eate. There remayned no more of all the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, but to take the Wine, when turning to me, hee ſaid: Now friend. for the moſt pleaſing ſeruice that euer thou didſt me, reach me the Cup. I did ſo alas, with a miſchiefe ouer diligent. As ſoone as he had it in his hand, with a voyce lowd ynough he ſaid: O pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull Gods, ſaid he, that know who I am, venge not my death vpon this faire Lady, who taking me for another man, more happy then I, hath brought me to my death: and at this word, drunke all that was in the Cup, which was contrary to the cuſtome, becauſe the husband was to drinke but halfe, and the Wife the reſt. She ſmiling, ſaid vnto him: And how friend <hi>Lidias?</hi> it ſeemes you haue forgotten the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, you ſhould haue left me my part. God forbid, ſaid hee, wife <hi>Ameryne,</hi> for it is of poyſon, which I haue choſen to end my life, rather then to be wanting in my promiſe to you, and in the affection which I owe to the faire <hi>Siluy.</hi> O God, ſaid ſhe, is it poſſible? as yet thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it was her true <hi>Lidias,</hi> but that hee had changed his good will, during his abſence, and vnwilling to liue without him, ran with the Cup in her hand, where he was that had giuen the Wine mixed; for the day before he had cauſed it to be made at the Apothecaries, and before it was knowne what my Maſter ſaid, notwithſtanding any
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:177519:192"/>
forbidding of his, becauſe it was the cuſtome they gaue her the full cup, which ſhe preſently drunke of. And then returning to him, ſhe ſaid, O cruell and ingratefull, thou haſt loued death more then me, and I alſo loue it rather then thy refuſall. But if that God which hath hitherto conducted our affections, doe not venge me on a ſoule ſo periured in another life, I ſhall thinke he hath neither care to heare falſe oathes, nor power to puniſh them.</p>
                  <p>Then euery one drew neere her to heare her reproches, and it was then that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> anſwered her. Diſcreete <hi>Amerine,</hi> I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe I haue offended you if I were he whom you thinke I am, but beleeue me that am now at the ende of my dayes, I am not <hi>Lidias,</hi> I am <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and whatſoeuer errour may bee of mee at this houre, I aſſure my ſelfe that time will diſcouer my iuſtice. And in the meane time, I rather chooſe death, then to be wanting to the affection which I haue promiſed to the faire <hi>Siluy,</hi> to whom I haue conſecrated my life, not being otherwiſe able to ſatisfie both.</p>
                  <p>And then hee continued, O faire <hi>Siluy,</hi> receiue this will which I offer you, and let this laſt of all my actions be beſt receiued, becauſe it is imprinted with the beſt character of my faithfulneſſe. By little and little the poyſon gained on the ſpirits of theſe two newly married, ſo that they could hardly draw their breath, when turning his eyes on me, he ſayd: Goe my friend, finiſh that thou haſt to doe, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all, truly recount what thou haſt ſeene, and that death is wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to me, that keepes me from offending the fidelitie which I haue vowed to the faire <hi>Siluy. Siluy</hi> was the laſt word hee ſpake, for with that word the faire ſoule parted from the body: and for my part, I beleeue that if euer louer were happy in the <hi>Eliſian</hi> fields, my maiſter is, attending vntill he may ſee you againe there.</p>
                  <p>And how ſayd <hi>Siluy,</hi> is it true that <hi>Ligdamon</hi> is dead? without doubt anſwered he. O God cryed out <hi>Siluy.</hi> At this word all that ſhe could doe was but to caſt her ſelfe on a bed, for her heart fayled her, and after ſhee had lyen ſomewhile with her face towards the beds head, ſhe prayed <hi>Leonide</hi> who was with her, to take <hi>Ligdamons</hi> letter, and to tell <hi>Egide</hi> that he ſhould goe to her lodging, becauſe ſhe would haue him ſerue her. So <hi>Egide</hi> withdrew, but ſo affected that he was couered with teares. Then would loue ſhew one of his puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances, for that Nymph that neuer loued <hi>Ligdamon</hi> while hee liued, at this time when ſhe heard of his death, ſhewed ſo great a feeling, that the moſt paſſionate in loue could not do more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:177519:192"/>
It was vpon this ſpeech that <hi>Galathee</hi> talking to <hi>Celadon,</hi> fayde, that hereafter ſhee would beleeue it is impoſſible, but a woman once in her life muſt loue ſome thing: for this young Nymph hath vſed ſuch cruelties towards all them that loued her, that ſome are dead for griefe, others euen of deſpaire haue baniſhed themſelues from her ſight; and eſpecially this whom ſhe be wailes dead, ſhe hath heretofore brought to that extremitie, that without <hi>Leonide</hi> the ſame had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen him then, ſo that I would rather haue ſworne, loue might ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue found place in the Ice of the coldeſt of the Alpes, then in her heart; and yet you ſee now whereto ſhe is reduced.</p>
                  <p>Madame, anſwered the ſhepheard, beleeue not that it is loue, it is rather pitie. In truth ſhe muſt be harder then euer was ſtone, if the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port which this yong man hath made, haue not touched her to the quicke, for I know not who would not in hearing him relate it, though one had no other knowledge of him but this onely action: and for my part, I muſt ſay true, I hold <hi>Ligdamon</hi> happyer then if he were aliue, ſince he loued this Nymph with ſuch affection, and ſhee vſed him with as great rigour as I haue knowne, for what greater happineſſe can befall him, then to ende his miſeries, and to enter into thoſe felicities which doe accompany them. What thinke you was his contentment to ſee that <hi>Siluy</hi> laments him, ſorrowes for him, and eſteemes of his affection: but I meane that <hi>Siluy</hi> that hath dealt ſo roughly with him. And then what is that which the louer deſires more then to bee able to giue aſſurance to the party beloued of his faithfulneſſe and affection; and to come to this point, what puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what deaths will he refuſe? At this time, when hee ſees from the place where he is, the teares of his <hi>Siluy,</hi> when he heares her ſight, what is his happineſſe, and what his glory? not onely for that he hath aſſured her of his loue, but for him to be certen that ſhe loues him.</p>
                  <p>O no Madame, beleeue me <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath no cauſe to complaine, but <hi>Siluy,</hi> for (and in time you ſhall ſee it) all that ſhee will repreſent to her ſelfe ſhall bee the ordinary actions of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> the diſcourſe of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> his faſhion, his amitie, his valour: briefly, this I dole will bee ordinarily houering about her, almoſt like an auenger of the cruelties with which ſhee hath tormented that poore louer, and repentance which galling her thoughts, will be the executioner of the Iuſtice of Loue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:177519:193"/>
THeſe ſpeeches were ſo lowde, and ſo neare <hi>Siluy</hi> that ſhee heard them all, and that made her burſt for anger, for ſhe thought them probable. At laſt, after ſhe had endured them ſome while, and finding her ſelfe too feeble to reſiſt ſo ſtrange enemies, ſhee went out of that chamber into her owne, where there were none to let her from teares. For hauing ſhut the dore after her, and prayde <hi>Leonide</hi> to leaue her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſhe caſt her ſelfe on her bed, her armes acroſſe her ſtomacke, and her eyes toward heauen, in her memory ſhee paſſed through all their life, what affection he had alwayes ſhewed to her, how patiently hee bore her rigours, with what diſcretion he had ſerued her, how long time this affection had laſted, and in the end, ſaid ſhe, all this is now encloſed in a little earth. And in this ſorrow remembring her owne diſcourſes, her adues, her impatiencies, and a thouſand ſmall particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larities, ſhe was conſtrained to ſay: Hold thy peace memory, let the aſhes of my <hi>Ligdamon</hi> be at reſt, ſince if thou thus torment me, I know he will diſauow thee for his, and if thou be not his, I care not for thee. At laſt, hauing ſtayed ſome while ſilent, ſhe ſaid, well the die is caſt, let it ſhorten or lengthen my life as pleaſe the gods, and my deſtinie, but I will not ceaſe to loue the memory of <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> to cheriſh his loue, and to honour his vertues. <hi>Galathee</hi> in the meane time opened the letter, which yet remained in <hi>Leonides</hi> hands, ſhee found it was thus.</p>

And who is, replyed the ſhepheard, this <hi>Mandrake?</hi> If by the Worke, ſaid <hi>Galathee,</hi> one may know the Workeman, to make good that I ſay, you will iudge ſhee is one of the greateſt Magicians of <hi>Gaule,</hi> for it is ſhe that by her enchantment hath made this Den, and diuers other rarities which are hereabout.</p>
                  <p>And entring in, the ſhepheard ſtood rauiſhed with conſideration of the workemanſhip. The entry was very high and ſpatious. On the two ſides, in ſtead of pillars, were two Termes, which on their heads ſuſtained the boughts of the vault of the portall. The one fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured <hi>Pan,</hi> the other <hi>Syrinx,</hi> which were very curiouſly adorned with ſtones of diuerſe colours: the haire, the eye-browes, the mouthchatos, the beard, and the two hornes of <hi>Pan</hi> were of Cockles from the ſea, and ſo workemanly ſet in, that the ciment appeared not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Syrinx,</hi> that was on the other ſide, had her haire of Roſes, and ſomewhat vnder the nauill one might ſee them ſwell by little and little: the tower of the gate on the outſide was of ruſticke faſhion, and ropes of coquils faſtened in foure corners hung downe, finiſhed neere the heads of the Termes. Within the Vault there was a rocke which ſeemed in many places to drop with Salt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peter, and ouer the midſt it opened with an ouall forme, through which the light came in. This, place, both without and within, was enriched with a great number of Statues, which falling into their ceſternes made diuerſe fountaines, and all repreſented ſome effect of the power of loue.</p>
                  <p>In the middle of the caue one might ſee the tombe rayſed the height of ten or twelue foote, which at the top ended like a crowne, and all about garniſhed with tables, whereof the painting was ſo well done, that the ſight deceiued the iudgement, the diſtance of euery table was filled by halfe pillars of blacke wrought marble, the coynes of the tombe, the baſes and the capitall of halfe colours, and the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes, which round about in faſhion of a girdle, held vp the tables, and though of diuerſe peeces, yet made but one well compoſed frame which was of the ſame marble.</p>
                  <p>The curioſitie of <hi>Celadon</hi> was great: after he had conſidered alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to deſire to know the particularities, and that he might giue the Nymph occaſion to tell him ſomething, hee commended the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention and cunning of the workman.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are, ſaid the Nymph, the Spirits of <hi>Mandrake,</hi> which after

                  </p>
                  <p>And how, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> is this the fountaine of the truth of Loue? No, anſwered the Nymph, but that is not farre hence, and I would I had ſpirit ynough to make you vnderſtand theſe Tables, for the Hiſtory is worthy to be knowne.</p>
                  <p>As ſhee drew neere to expound them to him, ſhe ſaw <hi>Adamas</hi> enter in: who being returned, and not finding the Nymphs at their Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings, iudged they were gone forth to walke; where after he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>SEe you in the firſt place this Shepheard ſet on the ground, his backe leaning to an Oake, his legge acroſſe, that playes on his pipe? This is the faire ſhepheard <hi>Damon,</hi> who hath name of faire for the perfection of his face. This yong ſhepheard fed his ſheepe along your ſweete <hi>Lignon</hi> being borne of one of the beſt families of mount <hi>Verdun,</hi> and no farre remoued kinſman of the old <hi>Cleontine,</hi> and of <hi>Leonides</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by conſequent in ſome ſort my kinſman. Marke how this viſage, beſides that it is faire, repreſents very liuely a perſon that had no care, but of his owne contentment: for you may ſee I know not what open and cleere countenance without trouble or cloude of buſie i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations. And on the contrary, turne your eyes vpon the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heardeſſes which are about him, you may iudge by the faſhion of their viſages, that they are not without paine, for as <hi>Damon</hi> had a free ſpirit, and reſtfull; ſo had the ſhepheardeſſes their hearts paſſionated for him. Yet as you ſee, he vouchſafeth not to looke towards them, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that they haue painted on the right ſide in the ayre that little naked childe with his bow and torch in his hand, his eyes b'inded, his backe winged, his ſhoulders charged with a quiuer, that threatens him on the other hand. This is Loue, who begin offended at the contempt which this ſhepheard ſhewed towards theſe ſhepheardeſſes, ſwore that he would be reuenged on him.</p>
                     <p>But for the better ſetting forth of the Table, note how well the Art of the painting is obſerued. You may ſee, me thinks, the arme of the ſhepheard ſinking a little vnder the ſwelling of the inſtrument, and how the cane where he blowes hath loſt his colour, that is, becauſe his moyſt mouth had put it out. Marke on the left hand how the ſheepe feede, ſee ſome of them lying in the ſhade, ſome licking their feet, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that aſtonied looke on the two Rammes, that run to puſh at one another with all their might.

See how he is ſet on the ground, how he hath tyed one end of his ſtring to his great toe, which giues backe a little as being too hard drawne.

Now marke a little lower along <hi>Lignon,</hi> ſee a flocke of ſheepe in the ſhadow, how ſome of them chaw the cud, and others hold their noſe to the ground to draw out the freſhneſſe.</p>
                     <p>This is <hi>Damons</hi> flocke that you may ſee if you turne your eyes hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward in the water to the middle.

And yet the ſunne is ſo curious that he finds paſſage betweene ſome of their leaues, for ſome of his beames. Note how well this ſhadow and this brightneſſe is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.

Now caſt your eye on the other ſide the riuer, if you be not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to looke on the deformed in her perfection, as in his owne you haue ſeene the faire, for among theſe fearefull bryars you may ſee the magician <hi>Mandrake</hi> be holding the ſhepheard in his bath. Behold her clothed almoſt in deſpite of them, that looke on her haire ſpread, one arme naked, her gowne on one ſide truſſed vp aboue her knee, I think ſhe comes to ſome in chantment. But iudge here the effect of a beauty. This olde Crone that you ſee ſo wrinkled, that euery moment of her life hath ſet a furrow in her face, leane, little, al gray, her haire halfe cut, all crooked, and for age fitter for the coffin then to liue, is not aſhamed to doate on this yong ſhepheard. If loue come by ſimpathy, as they ſay, I know not how it may bee found betweene <hi>Damon</hi> and her. See what countenance ſhe makes in her extaſie. Shee thruſts out her head with her long necke, ſhrugs vp her ſhoulders, holds downe her armes at length, and her hands claſped in her lap, and the ſport is, when ſhee thought to ſmile ſhe made a mouth.

Or if it be not for a wager, it is to make vs ſee in this old thing, that the dry wood burns better and more eaſily then the greene, or to ſhew his power on this old hoſteſſe of

                     <p>BVt let vs paſſe to the other. See a night well repreſented, ſee how vnder the darkneſſe, of theſe ſhadowes theſe mountains appeare, ſo as they ſhew but a little and ſo that in effect, one cannot iudge what it is. Marke how the ſtarres ſeemes to twinckle; ſee the others ſo well diſpoſed that one may know them. See the great Beare, looke how the iudicious workman, though ſhe haue twenty ſeuen ſtarres, yet he repreſenteth clearely but twelue; and of theſe twelue, yet he makes but ſeuen clearely ſhining.</p>
                     <p>See the little Beare, and conſider that, for that theſe ſeuen ſtarres are neuer hidden, though it hath none of the third magnitude, and loure of the fourth; yet he makes vs ſee them all, obſeruing their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. See the Dragon, in which he hath well ſet the thirty one ſtarres, but he hath not ſhewed them ſo well as the thirteene, fiue whereof as you ſee are of the fourth magnitude, and the eight of the third.</p>

                     <p>But theſe clouds are well repreſented, which in ſome places runne through the Skie with great largeneſſe, and in others onely, like a light ſmoake, and ſome allouer, and as they be more or leſſe rayſed, are more or leſſe bright.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs conſider the hiſtory of this Table: ſee <hi>Mandrak</hi> in the midſt of a circle, a white rod in her right hand, a booke all grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie in the other, with candle of virgins waxe, and thicke ſpectacles on her noſe. Looke how ſhe ſeemes to mumble, and how ſhe holds her eyes turnd after a ſtrange faſhion, her mouth halfe open, and making a countenance ſo ſtrange, with browes that ſhow ſhe trauels with af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. But haue regard how the foot, arme, and left ſhoulder are naked: that is, for that it is the ſide of the heart: theſe fancies that you
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:177519:198"/>
ſee about, are diuels, which by the force of her charmes ſhe hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to come to her, to know how ſhe may be beloued of <hi>Damon.</hi> They tell her of the affection which he beares to <hi>Fortune,</hi> that there is no better meane then to perſwade him that this ſhepheardeſſe loues elſewhere; and to do it more eaſily, ſhe muſt for this time change the vertue of the fountaine of the truth of Loue. Before you paſſe farther, conſider alittle the workemanſhip of the picture, ſee the effects of the Candle of <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

She hath all the left ſide of her face bright, and the reſt ſo darke, that it ſeemes to be of a different viſage; the mouth halfe open, ſeemes within to be bright, ſo farre as the opening will ſuffer the light to enter. And the arme which holds the Candle, you may ſee neare the hand very darke, becauſe the booke which ſhee holds ſhadowes it, and the reſt is ſo bright aboue that it makes the blackneſſe ſhew the more beneath. And with the like conſideration may bee obſerued the effects which the Candle giues among the diuels; for they all according as they are turned to it, are brighter or darker. And ſee another great peece of art in this picture, which is diſtance, for the perſpectiue is ſo well obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that you would thinke that this other accident which he would repreſent on the other ſide, is out of this table and farre diſtant from it; and yet this is <hi>Mandrake</hi> that is in the fountaine of the truth of Loue. But to make you vnderſtand all; know that ſometimes before a faire ſhepheardeſſe daughter, to a learned Magitian, fell ſecretly in loue with a ſhepheard, which her father perceiued not: were it for that the charmes of Magicke can do nothing ouer the charmes of loue: or were it that altogether atten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. So it was that after an hot burning amitie, for that in loue there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more inſupportable then diſdaine, and this ſhepheard negle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting her for that he had long time beene vowed elſewhere, ſhe was brought to that paſſe, that by little and little the fire increaſing, and her ſtrength diminiſhing, ſhe came to die, her fathers knowledge not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſuccour her. Whereat the Magitian being very ſorry when he knew the occaſion, for a marke of her memory euer after changed her tombe into a fountaine which he named the truth of loue, becauſe that he that loues, if he looke into it ſhall ſee his Lady, and if he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loued he ſhall ſee himſelfe by her, or him whom ſhe loues: or if ſhee loue none, ſhe appeares alone. And this is that truth which <hi>Mandrake</hi> would change, that <hi>Damon</hi> comming to ſee, and finding his miſtreſſe loued another, he ſhould looſe like wiſe the affection he bare her, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:177519:198"/>
ſo ſhe might haue the place free. And ſee how ſhe enchants it, what ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ractars ſhe makes round about, what triangles, what ſquares interlaid with rounds, beleeue ſhe forgets nothing which was neceſſary, for this affaires toucheth her too neare. Beforetime ſhe had by her charmes aſſembled all her diuels to finde remedy to her euill, but for that loue is more ſtrong then all this, they durſt not vndertake it againſt him, but onely counſelled her to worke this treaſon to theſe two faithfull lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers. And for aſmuch as the vertue of the fountaine came by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment of a Magitian <hi>Mandrake,</hi> which ſurmounted in this ſcience all her predeceſſors may put it out for a while. But let vs paſſe to the Table that followeth.</p>

                  <div n="5" type="subpart">

                     <p>THe fifth Table (continued <hi>Adamas)</hi> hath two actions. The firſt when <hi>Damon</hi> came to this fountaine to free him from the paine which a trouble ſome dreame had brought him, the other when decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the craft of <hi>Mandrake,</hi> hauing ſeene in the fountaine that the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Fortune</hi> loued another, in deſpaire he killed himſelfe.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs ſee how well they are repreſented. See <hi>Damon</hi> with his ſpeare, for he is in the ſame ſort ſet out as he was wont to go on hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Behold the way he followes, marke with what care his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beaſt attends his maiſter, for while he lookes into the fountaine, it ſeemes the eyes are ſo bent towards him, to be deſirous to know what maketh him ſo abaſhed; that if you conſider the aſtoniſhment which is painted in his face, you would iudge he had ſome great cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Mandrake</hi> had made him ſee in a dreame, <hi>Maradon</hi> a young ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard that taking an arrow from <hi>Cupid,</hi> opend the boſome of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and tooke out her heart.</p>
                     <p>He that following the ordinary courſe of louers was yet in doubt, and as ſoone as it was day ranne to this fountaine to ſee if his miſtreſſe loued him. I beſeech you conſider his abaſhment, for if you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the viſages of the other Tables to this, you ſhall ſee the ſame draughts, though the trouble wherein hee is, paint the chaunge much.</p>
                     <p>Of thoſe two Figures which you doe ſee in the Fountaine, the one as you may plainely know, is of the Shepheardeſſe <hi>Fortune,</hi> and the other you may ſee is of the Shepheard <hi>Moradon,</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:177519:199"/>
whom the Magician made to bee repreſented rather then another, becauſe he knew he had a long time bin a ſeruant of the ſhepheardeſſe, and though ſhe vouchſafed not to regard him, yet loue which eaſily beleeues the thing it feares, preſently perſwaded the contrary to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon:</hi> beleefe that made him reſolue to dy. Marke I pray you how this water ſeems to tremble, this is for that the Painter would repreſent the effect of the teares of the ſhepheard which fell into it. But let vs paſſe to the ſecond action. See how the continuation of this Caue is made, and how truly this ſeems to be more declining.</p>
                     <p>This dead man that you ſee on the ground, is the poore <hi>Damon,</hi> who in diſpaire thruſt his ſpeare through his body. The action which he doth is very naturall. You may ſee one leg ſtretched out, the other drawne vp as with paine: one arme layd vnder the body, as hauing bin ſurpriſed by the ſuddenneſſe of the fall, and not hauing force to come againe to himſelfe, and the other languiſhing along the body, yet he holds gently the ſpeare in his hand, his head hanging towards his right ſhoulder, his eyes halfe ſhut, and halfe turned vp and he that ſees him in ſuch a caſe, may well iudge him to be a man in the trances of death; his mouth ſomewhat opened, the teeth in ſome places diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered a little, and the paſſages of his noſe ſhrunke vp, all ſignes of a late dead man.</p>
                     <p>Alſo he hath not figured him as wholly dead, but betweene death and life, if there be any ſeparation betweene them. See here the ſpeare well repreſented, you may ſee the breadth of the Iron halfe hidden in the wound, the ſtaffe on the one ſide bloody, on the other, of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour it was before. But how great hath the Painters diligence bene, he hath not forgot the nayles which go as weeping towards the end, for the nearer the ſhaft as well the as wood, the more they were ſtaynd with blood. It is true, that through the blood you might know them.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs conſider the ſpurting out of the blood, iſſuing out of the wound. Me thinkes it is like a fountaine, which being led by long channels from ſome higher place, when it hath bene reſtrained, as they open it ſkips in fury this way and that way: for ſee theſe ſtreames of blood, how well they are repreſented, conſider the boyling which ſeemes to raiſe it ſelfe to bubbles. I thinke nature cannot repreſent any thing more truely.</p>

                     <p>NOw for the ſixt and laſt Table, which contaynes foure actions of the Shepheardeſſe <hi>Fortune.</hi> The firſt, is a Dreame which <hi>Mandrake</hi> made her haue: The other, how ſhee went to the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne, to cleare her doubt: The third, how ſhee complaynes of the inconſtancie of her Shepheard: and the laſt, how ſhee dyes; which is the concluſion of this Tragedie. Now let vs ſee all things particularly.</p>
                     <p>See the riſing of the Sunne, note the length of the ſhadowes, and how on the one ſide the Heauen is yet leſſe cleare. See theſe clouds, which are halfe ayre as it ſeemeth, which by little and little flye, lifting vp theſe little birds, which ſeeme to ſing as they mount, and are of thoſe kinde of Larkes that riſe from the deaw in the new Sunne. Theſe ill-formed birds, which with vncertaine flight goe to hide themſelues, are of thoſe Owles that auoid the Sunne: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Mountaine couers a good part, and the other ſhines to cleare, that one cannot iudge that it was other thing then a great and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed brightneſſe.</p>
                     <p>Let vs goe forward. Behold the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Fortune</hi> aſleepe, ſhee is in bed, where the Sunne that enters by the window open by negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, diſcouers halfe her breſt. She hath one arme careleſly ſtretched along the ſide of the bedſtead, her hand a little hanging from the boulſter, the other hand ſtretched along her thigh, without the bed, and for that her ſmocke ſleeues is by chance thruſt vp, you may ſee it aboue the Elbowe, there being nothing that hides any of the armes beautie.</p>
                     <p>See about her the diuels of <hi>Morpheus,</hi> wherewith <hi>Mandrake</hi> ſerues herſelfe, to giue her a will to go to the fountaines of the truth of Loue. See on this ſide what ſhe caſteth vp: for hauing dreamed that her ſhepheard was dead, and taking his death for the loſſe of his amitie, ſhe came to know the truth. Beholde how the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull viſage by the ſweetneſſe of it mooues pittie, and makes vs take part in her diſpleaſure; becauſe ſhee no ſooner caſts her veiwe into the water but ſhe perceiues <hi>Damon.</hi> But alas, hard by him the ſhepheardeſſe <hi>Melide,</hi> a faire ſhepheardeſſe indeed, and which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:177519:200"/>
was not without ſuſpition of louing <hi>Damen,</hi> yet vnbeloued of him.</p>
                     <p>Deceiued with this falſehood, ſee how ſhee is retyred into the inwarrd parts of the Denne, and commeth vnawares to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her diſpleaſure, in the ſame place where <hi>Damon</hi> was almoſt dead.</p>
                     <p>Behold her ſet againſt the rocke, her armes acroſſe her breſt, which choller and griefe made her diſcouer, in tearing that which was vppon it. It ſeemeth that ſhee ſighes, and her breſt pants, her face and eyes lifting vp, and asking vengeance from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for the perfidiouſneſſe which ſhee thought was in <hi>Damon.</hi> And becauſe the tranſport of her euill, made her lift vppe her voyce in her complaynt. <hi>Damon</hi> whom you ſee by her, though hee were euen at the laſt of all his life, hearing the laments of his fayre Shepheardeſſe, and knowing the voyce, hee then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced himſelfe to call her. Shee which heard theſe dying words, ſuddenly turning her head went to him.</p>
                     <p>But O God what a ſight was this? She quite forgot, ſeeing him in this caſe, and the occaſion ſhee had to complayne of him, ſhee demaunded who had dealt ſo fouly with him? It is ſayde hee, the change of my fortune, it is the inconſtancie of your ſoule which hath deceiued mee with ſuch demonſtrations of goodwill. Briefely, it is the happineſſe of <hi>Macadon,</hi> whom the Fountaine from whence you came ſhewed mee to bee by you. And doe you thinke it reaſonable that hee ſhould liue ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing loſt your loue; that liued not but to bee beloued of you? <hi>Fortune</hi> hearing theſe words. Ah <hi>Damon,</hi> how lying is this Spring to our vndoing, ſince it made mee ſee <hi>Melide</hi> neare vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, whom I now ſee die for ſo dearely louing me.</p>
                     <p>So theſe faithfull louers knew well the falſehood of this Fountaine, and more aſſured then euer of their affection, they dyed embracing: <hi>Damon</hi> of the wound, and ſhee for griefe of his death.</p>
                     <p>Behold the ſhepheardeſſe ſet againſt the rock couered with moſſe, and ſee <hi>Damon</hi> leaning his head in her lappe, and who to giue her the laſt farewell, reached foorth his arme and necke to her, ſeeming to ſtraine and raiſe himſelfe a little to kiſſe her: in the meane time, ſhee all couered with blood held his head, and

But while they wereabout their buſineſſe, ſee <hi>Galathee</hi> commeth in ſo ſuddenly, that <hi>Celadon</hi> could not get into the Cabinet: you may well iudge that the Nymph and <hi>Celadon</hi> were ſurpriſed, but the ſubtilty of <hi>Leonide</hi> was greater and quicker then it was credible: for ſeeing <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee</hi> enter, ſhe tooke hold on <hi>Celadon,</hi> who would haue run to hide himſelfe, and turning toward the Nymph, did what ſhe could to ſtay him. Madame, ſayd ſhe, if it pleaſe you not to do ſomewhat, that my Lady your mother come not hither, we are all vndone: for my part, I haue done what I could to diſguiſe <hi>Celadon,</hi> but I feare I cannot bring it about. <hi>Galathee,</hi> who at the firſt knew not what to iudge of this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis, commended the ſpirit of <hi>Leonide</hi> for inuenting this ſhift, and comming neerer to conſider <hi>Celadon</hi> ſo well diſguiſed vnder this habit, that ſhe could not hold from laughter: anſwered the Nymph, Friend, we had bin vndone but for you, for there was no meane to hide the ſhepheard from ſo many perſons as come with <hi>Amaſis,</hi> where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clad in this habit, we are not onely more aſſured, but withall I would haue you let your other companions ſee her, that they may take her for a maide. And then ſhe went on the other ſide, and was rauiſhed in beholding him; for his beauty by theſe ornaments made the greater ſhow. In the meane time, <hi>Leonide</hi> the better to play her part, told her that ſhe might be gone, for feare leſt <hi>Amaſis</hi> came ſuddenly on her. So the Nymph, after ſhe had reſolued that <hi>Celadon</hi> ſhould call himſelfe the kinſwoman of <hi>Adamas,</hi> named <hi>Lucinde,</hi> went out to entertaine her mother, after ſhe had commanded <hi>Leonide</hi> to bring her where they were as ſoone as ſhe could be dreſt. I muſt confeſſe the truth, ſayd <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladon,</hi> after ſhe was gone, in my life was I neuer more aſtoniſhed then at theſe three accidents; at the comming of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> at the ſurpriſall of <hi>Galathee,</hi> and at your quicke inuention.</p>
               <p>Shepheard ſayd ſhe, that which I do proceedes of the good will I haue to rid you of your paine, and would to God all the reſt of your contentment would ſort as luckily as this doth, then you ſhould know how much good I wiſh you. For requitall of ſo great an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, anſwered the ſhepheard, I can but offer you the life which you haue preſerued: with ſuch diſcourſes they entertained themſelues, till <hi>Merill</hi> came into the chamber, and ſeeing <hi>Celadon</hi> almoſt ready, he was rauiſhed, and ſayd: There is no body that can know him, and I that am all day with him, would not beleeue it is he, vnleſſe I ſaw him dreſſing.<hi>Celadon</hi> anſwered him, who told you I was diſguiſed. Thus it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:177519:202"/>
was, anſwered he: My Lady who commanded me to call you <hi>Lucinde,</hi> and that I ſhould ſay you are the kinſwoman of <hi>Adamas,</hi> and ſent me preſently to the <hi>Druide</hi> to let him know it, who could not forbeare laughter when he heard it, and he promiſed me to do as my Lady had appointed. See that all things goe well, ſayd the ſhepheard, and take heed you forget not your ſelfe. In the meane time, <hi>Amaſis</hi> being come out of her charriot, met <hi>Galathee</hi> at the ſtayres foote, with <hi>Siluy</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas.</hi> Daughter, ſayd ſhe, you haue bene ouer long in your ſolitari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, I muſt recreate you a little, ſpecially, for that newes which I haue ſeene from <hi>Clidaman</hi> and <hi>Lindamor,</hi> doe reioyce me, that I can enioy it no longer alone: therefore came I vnto you to giue you a part, and deſire to haue you goe with me to <hi>Marcellis,</hi> where I will haue bonefires made for ſo good newes. I thanke God, anſwered <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lathee,</hi> for ſo great happineſſe, and I beſeech God to keepe you yet an age longer: but indeed Madame, the place is ſo pleaſing to me, that it makes mee ſorry to leaue it. It ſhall not bee long, replyed <hi>Amaſis,</hi> but becauſe I will not goe backe till toward night, let vs go walke, and I will tell you al that I haue learned. Then <hi>Adamas</hi> kiſſed her robe and ſayd; your newes madame muſt be good, ſince to tell them to my Lady your daughter, you came abroad ſo early. It is two or three daies, ſayd <hi>Amaſis,</hi> ſince I receiued them, and ſuddenly reſolued to come hither, for me thinks I cannot ioy at ſuch contentment alone, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the thing deſerues to be knowne. With ſuch diſcourſe ſhe deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into the garden, where beginning to walke, hauing <hi>Galathee</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Adamas</hi> on the other, ſhe went on in this ſort.</p>

I aſſure my ſelfe, ſince that time, you cannot be ignorant of the deſigne that made them both depart ſo ſecretly, to ſeeke out <hi>Meroue,</hi> nor that I might not leaue <hi>Clidaman</hi> alone in a place ſo farre off, I ſent after him vnder the charge of <hi>Lindamor,</hi> a company of yong knights of this country, but you can hardly know what befell them ſince their departure, and that is it which I will now tell you, for there is nothing more worthy to be knowne.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as <hi>Clidaman</hi> came to thearmy, <hi>Guimantes</hi> who was well knowne there, brought him to kiſſe the hands of <hi>Meroue</hi> and <hi>Childe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke,</hi> and without ſhewing who he was only gaue them to vnderſtand that he was a yong knight, of a good houſe, that deſired to ſerue them.

But when <hi>Lindamor</hi> was come, and that they knew what <hi>Clidaman</hi> was, the honour and welcome which they did him cannot be told, for within two or three fights he was ſo famous, that both his friends and enemies knew him and eſteemed of him.</p>
                  <p>Among other priſoners which he and <hi>Guimantes</hi> tooke, for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they went together in all enterpriſes, they found a youth of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> ſo faire, but ſo ſad, that it wrought pittie in <hi>Clidaman,</hi> and becauſe the longer he remained in captiuitie, the more appeared his ſorrow: one day he cauſed him to be called before him, and after he had enquired of his eſtate and condition, he asked the occaſion of his ſadneſſe, ſaving, that if it proceeded of his impriſonment, he muſt like a man of courage beare ſuch accidents, and he was to thanke the heauens that had prouided hee ſhould fall into their hands, ſince hee was in a place where he ſhould receiue nothing but curteſie, and the delay of his libertie proceeded but from the command of <hi>Merou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>This yong man thanked him, yet was not able to forbeare fighing, whereat <hi>Clidaman</hi> ſomewhat more moued, demanded the cauſe, to whom he anſwered: Sir knight, this ſadneſſe which you ſee painted in my face, and theſe ſighes which ſteale ſo often from my breſt proceed not of this priſon you ſpeak of, but of another which binds me more ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sir Knight, this habit wherein you ſee me, is not mine owne, but Loue, who ſometimes hath cloathed men like women playes with me in this fort, and making me forget in part what I am, hath put me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an habit contrary to mine owne, for I am not a man, but a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of one of the beſt Houſes of <hi>Brutayne,</hi> and called <hi>Mellandra,</hi> fallen into your hands by the greateſt fortune that euer was conducted by Loue. It is ſome while ſince a young man named <hi>Lidias,</hi> came to <hi>London,</hi> flying out of his owne Countrey (as I haue heard ſince) for hauing killed his enemy in field. They were both of that part of <hi>Gaule,</hi> which they call <hi>Normandy:</hi> but becauſe the dead man was of kindred to the greateſt among them, he was enforced to flye hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Countrey, to auoid the rigour of Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>Thus being then come to <hi>London,</hi> is the cuſtome of our Nation, hee found ſuch courteſie that there was no good Houſe wherein he was not right ſoone familiar: among others, hee liued with that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uacie at my fathers, as if hee had beene of his houſehold. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had a purpoſe to ſtay there as long as his returne into his Countrey ſhould be forbidden him, he determined to make ſhew of louing ſome, that he might the better frame himſelfe to the humour of them of great <hi>Brittany,</hi> that haue euery one ſome particular Lady. On this reſolution he turned (I know not whether I may ſay for good or euill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ortune) his eyes on me, were it that he found me more for his delight or more for his commoditie, he began to profeſſe himſelfe to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:177519:204"/>
be my ſeruant. What diſſimulations, what wooings, what oathes were thoſe which he vſed to me? I will not trouble you with an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlong diſcourſe. So it was, that after ſufficient long wooing (for hee continued two yeeres) I loued him without diſſimulation, for that his beautie, his courteſie, his diſcretion, and valour, were ouer-great allurements to ouercome with long ſuit any ſoule, how barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſoeuer. I bluſh not then to confeſſe it to one that hath had tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Loue, nor to ſay, that this beginning then was the end of my quiet.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe things reſting in this ſtate, and liuing with all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment that the party that loues and is aſſured of the perſon belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, may haue; it fell out, that the <hi>Franks,</hi> after they had wonne ſo many battailes againſt the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperours againſt the <hi>Gothes</hi> and <hi>Gaules,</hi> turned their Armes againſt the <hi>Normans,</hi> and reduced them to thoſe termes, that becauſe they are their ancient Allies, they were conſtrayned to ſend to <hi>London,</hi> to demaund ſuccours; which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the allyance made betweene them and thoſe of great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> was graunted them both by the King and by the Eſtates. This newes was ſuddenly divulged throughout the Realme; and we that were of the principall Towne, vnderſtood it with the firſt: And from that time, <hi>Lidias</hi> began to thinke of his returne; aſſuring himſelfe, that they of his ſide hauing neede of his like, would eaſily abſolue him of the death of <hi>Aronte.</hi> Notwithſtanding, becauſe hee had alwayes promiſed mee, not to goe, but hee would carry mee with him, which the malicious man did to deceiue me, and for feare leſt I might impeach his departure, hee concealed his purpoſe from mee. But as there is no fire ſo cloſely couered, from which there comes not ſome ſmoke, ſo there is nothing ſo ſecret, but ſome thing or other will diſcouer it; and ſo many, before I was aware, told mee of it.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as I knew it, the firſt time I ſaw him, I drew him aſide: Well (ſaid I) <hi>Lidias,</hi> haue you reſolued that I ſhall not know that you will leaue me? Thinke you my amitie ſo weake, that it cannot beare out the ſtrokes of your fortune? If your affaires will haue you returne into your Countrey, why will not your loue permit mee to goe with you? Demaund me of my father, I am aſſured hee will bee pleaſed with our allyance, for I know hee loues you: but to leaue mee here alone with your faith forſworne, no <hi>Lidias,</hi> beleeue mee, doe not commit ſo great a fault, for the Gods will puniſh you.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:177519:204"/>
He anſwered me coldly, that he had no thought of returne, and that all his affaires were nothing worth to the good of my preſence, that I committed an offence in doubting, and that his actions ſhould conſtrayne me to confeſſe as much. And yet this periured perſon within two dayes after went away with the firſt Troupes that came from great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> and tooke his time ſo fitly, that hee came to the Sea ſhore the ſame day that they were to goe, and ſo tooke ſhip with them. We were preſently aduertiſed of his departure: Yet had I ſo ſtrong a fancie that he loued me, that I was the laſt that beleeued it; ſo that there were more then eight dayes after his departure, before I could perſwade my ſelfe, that one ſo well borne could be ſo deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and vnthankfull. At laſt, one day following after another with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any newes, I found I was deceiued, and <hi>Lidias</hi> was gone.</p>
                  <p>If then my ſorrow were great, iudge you Sir Knight, ſince falling ſicke, I was brought to thoſe termes, that my Phyſitians not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my diſeaſe, deſpayred of me, and forſaking me, held me for dead. But Loue, who would ſhew his power, and is a better Phyſitian then <hi>Eſculapius,</hi> healed me with a ſtrange Antidote. And ſee how hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in effects which are contrary to our reſolution. When I firſt knew of the flight of <hi>Lidias,</hi> for in truth it may be ſo called, I found my ſelfe in ſuch ſort diſpleaſed, that after I had a thouſand times cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Heauen to witneſſe of his perfidiouſneſſe, I ſware I would neuer loue him, as often as hee had ſworne to mee, that hee would euer loue mee, and I may tell you wee were both forſworne. For while my hatred was in his greateſt fury, behold a Veſſell that came from <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays,</hi> to report, that the Succours were happily arriued, that told vs, that <hi>Lidias</hi> went ouer with an intent to warre among them of great <hi>Brittaine:</hi> but as ſoone as the Gouernour of the place, who was a kinſman to <hi>Aronte,</hi> vnderſtood of it, hee cauſed him to bee put in priſon, as hauing beene alreadie condemned; that they accounted him for loſt, becauſe the Gouernour was of great credit among the <hi>Normans,</hi> that indeede there was one meane to ſaue him, but ſo hard, that there was no man that would hazard it, beeing ſuch an one.</p>
                  <p>As ſoone as <hi>Lidias</hi> ſaw himſelfe arreſted, hee demaunded, how a Knight of ſuch reputation as hee was, would reuenge his quarrels by Iuſtice, and not by Armes? for it is a cuſtome among the <hi>Gaules,</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to runne to Iuſtice in what offends their Honor, but to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and they that doe otherwiſe, are held diſhonourable.</p>

                     <hi>Lipandas,</hi> which was the name of the Gouernour, anſwered, That he ſlew not <hi>Aronte</hi> like a man, and if he were not condemned by lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, he would maintaine it by Armes: but being aſhamed to fight with one attainted, if he had any of his friends that would offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for him, he proffered to fight in that quarrell, that if he were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome, he would ſet him at liberty, that otherwiſe luſtice ſhould be done. And to giue time to his kinsfolkes and friends, he would keepe him a moneth in his cuſtody, that if none come within that time, hee would giue him ouer into the rigorous hands of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of <hi>Roa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

But <hi>Lipandas</hi> being accounted one of the valinteſt men in all <hi>Normandy,</hi> there was not one that had the hardineſſe to vndertake this combate, beſides that the friends of <hi>Lidias</hi> not vnderſtanding of it could not performe that good office. Sir knight, when I remember the contraries, which ſhake me when I heard this newes, I muſt confeſſe I was neuer more confounded in my life, no not when this perfidious man forlooke me. Then would Loue haue me know, that the propoſitions made againſt him are more weake when he will, then the waues that beat in vaine againſt the rock to make it ſhake: for to pay the tribute of Loue, you muſt run to the ordinary moneys with which his impoſts are payd, which are teares. But after long and vaine bewailing the perſidious <hi>Lidias,</hi> I muſt in the end reſolue of his ſafetie, thogh it coſt me both my reſtan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And tranſported with this new furie, or rather with this renewing of Loue I reſolued to go to <hi>Callais,</hi> with an intent to finde the meanes there to aduertiſe the kinſmen and friends of <hi>Lidias,</hi> and giuing order with as great ſecreſie as I could for my voyage. one night I ſtole away in the habit you ſee me; but my fortune was ſo hard, that I ſtayd aboue fifteene dayes before I could find a ſhip that went that way. I know not what became of my parents when they ſaw I was gone, for I heard no newes of them ſince, onely I know the old age of my poore father can hardly beare out this griefe, for he loued me more tenderly then I did my ſelfe, and hath euer ſo carefully bred me, that I am often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times aſtonied how I could endure the diſcommodities which ſince my departure I haue borne, and I muſt ſay, it is Loue, and not my ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>But to hold on our courſe, after I had ſtayd fifteene or ſixteene daies at the Sea ſide, at laſt there came a ſhip in which I went to <hi>Callais,</hi> when
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:177519:205"/>
I had no more then fiue or ſixe dayes of the Terme that <hi>Lipandas</hi> had giuen. The toſsing of the ſhip had ſo diſtempered me, that I was conſtrained to keepe my bed two dayes, ſo that I had no time to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſe kinſmen of <hi>Lidias,</hi> eſpecially not knowing who they were, nor where they dwelt. If this troubled me you may iudge, eſpecially becauſe me thought I was come at the time to ſee him die, and to be preſent at his funerals. O Gods how do you diſpoſe vs! I was ſo ouerlayd with this diſaſter, that day and night the teares were in mine eyes. At laſt, the day before the Terme, tranſported with a deſire to dye before <hi>Lidias,</hi> I reſolued to enter into the combat againſt <hi>Lipandas:</hi> What reſolution, or rather what deſpaire was this? for all my life long I neuer tooke ſword in my hand, &amp; knew not well with which hand to hold the dagger or the ſword, and yet behold me reſolued to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to combat with a knight, who all his life had bene vſed to that myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, and who had alwaies wonne the title of braue and valiant. But all theſe conſiderations were nothing againſt me, that choſe to die be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he whom I loued, loſt his life. And though I knew well I could not ſaue him, yet was it no little ſatisfaction to me, that he ſhould haue that proofe of my loue.</p>
                  <p>One thing tormented me infinitely, which I endeauoured to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, which was the feare leſt <hi>Lidias</hi> might know me, and left that might hinder my deſigne, becauſe we were to fight vnarmed. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which, I ſent a ſcroule to <hi>Lipandas,</hi> whereby after I had deſyed him, I deſired, that being both knights, wee might ſerue our ſelues of the armor which knights vſe, and not like deſperate perſons. Hee anſwered, that the next morning he would be in the field, and that I might come armed, and ſo would he, though he would haue it at his owne choyce: after he had begunne the combat in that ſort, for my ſatisfaction, to finiſh it for his owne, as he had propounded at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. I that doubted not, but in what ſortſoeuer I was to die, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted what he would. And with this purpoſe in the morning, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented my ſelfe in the field armed at all poynts; but I muſt confeſſe the truth, I was ſo combred with my armor, that I knew not how to ſtirre. They that ſaw me go ſtaggering, thought it was for feare of the combat, and it was out of weakeneſſe. Soone after, behold <hi>Lipandas</hi> came armed, and mounted to his aduantage, who at his firſt ſetting out made them afraide, whom the danger no way touched: and beleeue you not that I was amazed. But when the poore <hi>Lidias</hi> was brought on a ſcaffold, to be preſent at the combat; for the pitie which I had to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:177519:206"/>
ſee him in ſuch caſe, touched me ſo that I ſtayd long without being able to ſtirre. At laſt the Iudges led me to him, to know if he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me for his champion. Hee asked me who I was, then counterfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my voyce: content your ſelfe <hi>Lidias,</hi> ſayd I, I that am the onely man that will vndertake this fight for you. Since it is ſo, replyed hee, you muſt be a perſon of valour, and therefore ſayd he, turning to the Iudges, I accept him, and as I was going, he ſayd, Valiant knight feare not but our quarrell is iuſt. <hi>Lidias,</hi> anſwered I, I would you had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther iniuſtice, and then I withdrew my ſelfe ſo reſolued to dye, that I hardly tarryed for the trumpets giuing ſignall of battaile. Indeede at the firſt ſound I ſet forward, but my horſe ſhooke me ſo ſore, that in ſtead of bearing my lance as I ſhould, I let it go as Fortune would, ſo that in place of ſtriking him, I thruſt it into the necke of the horſe, leauing the ſpeare in his body, whereupon the horſe ranne at the firſt about the field in deſpite of his maiſter, at laſt fell downe dead. <hi>Lipan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was comming againſt me with ſuch an eagerneſſe to do well, that his ouer great deſire made him miſſe his blow: for my part, my horſe went whither he would, for all that I could doe was to keepe my ſelfe from falling, and ſtopping of himſelfe, and hearing <hi>Lipandas</hi> crying to me to turne him, with many reuilings, for that I had killed his horſe, I came backe, when I had layd my hand on my ſword the beſt I could, and not without paine; but my horſe which happily I had ſpurred more then his courage would beare, as ſoone as I had turned him, of himſelfe tooke his courſe, and to ſo good purpoſe, that hee ſmote <hi>Lipandas</hi> with ſuch fury, that hee caſt him downe with his heeles vpward, but as he paſſed by, he gaue him with his ſword ſuch a thruſt into the body, that within a while after I perceiued him to ſinke vnder me, and it was no ſmali thing that I could remember to take my feete out of the ſtirrops, for to get out of the ſaddle, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light from my horſe.</p>
                  <p>Then came I toward him, who was at hand with his ſword a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſt to ſtrike me, and I muſt tell you, that if Loue had not ſuſtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the burthen of armes, I had not had the force to do it.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, behold <hi>Lipandas,</hi> who with all his force came to charge mee with a blow on the head: nature taught mee to thruſt forward my left arme, for otherwiſe I had forgotten the ſhield that hung on that arme, the blow lighted ſo full on it, that wanting ſtrength to beare it, my ſhield gaue mee backe ſuch a blow vpon my helmet,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:177519:206"/>
that the ſparkes flew out of mine eyes. Hee that ſaw how I ſtaggered, meant to charge mee afreſh, with another more weighty, but my fortune was ſuch, that lifting vp my ſword, I met his to ſo good a purpoſe that it brake into two peeces; and mine halfe broken, did like his at the firſt blow which I would haue giuenhim: For he ſhrunke backe, and I not hauing ſtrength to ſtay it, let it fall to the ground, where towards to point it lighted on a ſtone that broke it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lipandas</hi> then ſeeing vs both haue the like aduantage, ſayde to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Knight, theſearmes haue beene alike fauourable to vs: I meane to try whether the other will bee ſo to, and therefore diſarme your ſelfe, for it is with that that I will end the fight. Knight, anſwered I, by that which is paſſed you may well know that you haue done wrong, and deliuering <hi>Lidias</hi> you ought to leaue this combat.</p>
                  <p>No no, ſayde <hi>Lipandas</hi> in choller, <hi>Lidias</hi> and you ſhall die. I ſhall aſſay, replyed I, to turne that ſentence vpon your owne head, and then remouing in the field the fartheſt I could from <hi>Lidias,</hi> for feare of being knowne: By the helpe of thoſe that attended, I diſarmed my ſelfe; and for that we had made proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before of a Sword and Dagger, after wee had put off our doublets, wee came each againſt other. I muſt tell you, it was not without payne that I couered my breſt, becauſe the ſhirt, for all that I could doe, ſhewed the ſwelling of my pappes; but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one rather thought of any thing elſe then of that, and as for <hi>Lidias</hi> hee could not know it, as well for that hee ſaw mee in an habite diſguiſed, as for that I was enflamed with the heate of the armour, and this high colour much changed my viſage. At laſt, behold vs, <hi>Lipandas</hi> and mee, about ten or twelue paces a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der they parted the ſunne betwixt vs, and the Iudges were gone backe. It was then that I thought verily to die, aſſuring my ſelfe, that at the firſt blow hee would runne his Sword into my body.</p>
                  <p>But fortune was ſo good for <hi>Lidias,</hi> (for it was onely of his life that I ſtood in feare) that this, arrogant <hi>Lipandas</hi> comming with all his furie to mee, ſtumbled ſo, to purpoſe for me, that hee layde his head almoſt at my feete ſo violently, that hee gaue himſelfe two wounds, the one with his Dagger, with which hee pierced his left ſhoulder, and the other with his Sword, cutting his brow.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:177519:207"/>
For my part, I was ſo afraide of his fall, that I thought him already dead, and without doing him more hurt, I gaue backe two or three paces. It is true, that imagining I might better ouercome him with courteſie then valour, I ſayd vnto him: Riſe vp <hi>Lipandas,</hi> it is not on the earth that I will offend you. He that had ſtood ſome time amazed with the blow, all in rage riſeth to caſt himſelfe on me, but the two wounds which he had made himſelfe, the one blinded him, and the other tooke all ſtrength from his arme, ſo that he ſaw nothing, and was ſcarce able to hold vp his ſword; which I perceiuing, tooke cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and came towards him with my ſword aloft: Yeeld thy ſelfe <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandas,</hi> other wiſe thou art dead. Why, ſayd he, ſhould I yeeld my ſelfe, ſince the conditions of our combat was not ſo? Content thy ſelfe that I ſet <hi>Lidias</hi> at I bertie.</p>
                  <p>And then the ludges being come, and <hi>Lipandas</hi> hauing ratified his promiſe, they accompanyed me out of the campe like a conquerour. But fearing they might doe me ſome wrong in that place, where <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandas</hi> had ſuch power, after I had armed my ſelfe, I went with my viſard downe to <hi>Lidias,</hi> and ſayd: Sir <hi>Lidias</hi> thanke God for my victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and if you deſire to conferre longer with me, I go to the towne of <hi>Regiaque,</hi> where I will expect ſome newes from you in fifteene dayes, for after that time, I am conſtrained to go about ſome other occaſions, which carry me farre from hence; and you may aske for the fadde knight, for that is the name I beare, for the reaſon which you ſhall know hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Shall I not otherwiſe know him (ſaid he) to whom I am ſo much obliged? Neither for your good (fayde I) nor for mine may it be; and at that word I left him: and after I had prouided another horſe, I came to <hi>Regiaque,</hi> where I ſtayd.</p>
                  <p>Now this traytor <hi>Lipandas,</hi> as ſoone as I was gone, made <hi>Lidias</hi> bee put againe into priſon more ſtraitly then before, and when hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained and reproched him for breach of promiſe which he had made me; he anſwered, he promiſed to ſet him at libertie, but he told him not when, and that it ſhould be within 20. yeares, vnleſſe it were with a condition which he propounded; which was to work ſo, that I would commit my ſelf priſoner in his place, and ſo I ſhould pay the ranſome of his libertie with loſſe of mineowne. <hi>Lidias</hi> anſwered him, ſo hee ſhould be as ingratefull to me, as <hi>Lipandas</hi> perfidious to him. Whereat he was ſo offended, that he ſwore that within 15. daies if I were not in his hands, he would giue him vp into the hands of Iuſtice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:177519:207"/>
And when <hi>Lidias</hi> ſet before his eyes his faith forſworne: I haue done penance, ſaid hee, by the Wounds which I brought from the Combat, but hauing long time promiſed the Lords of <hi>Normandy</hi> to maintaine Iuſtice, am I not more bound to the former, then to the latter promiſe?</p>
                  <p>The former dayes paſſed ouer without any heed taking: but ſeeing I heard no newes of him, I ſent a man to enquire for him. By him I knew the malice of <hi>Lipandas,</hi> and the terme that hee had giuen: and though I well fore-ſaw all the cruelties and all the indignities which one might receiue, yet did I reſolue to free <hi>Lidias</hi> out of ſuch hands, hauing nothing ſo deare to me as his conſeruation; and by fortune, the day that you tooke me, I was going thither. And at this time, the heauineſſe which you ſee in me, and the ſighes which giue me no reſt, proceed not from the priſon wherein I am (for this is pleaſant, in reſpect of that which was propounded) but to thinke, how this perfidious and cruell <hi>Lipandas</hi> will without doubt commit him into the hands of his enemies, who expect no other thing, but to ſee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable and ſhamefull end: for of the fifteene dayes which he gaue, tenne are paſſed; ſo that I almoſt deſpayre to be able to doe this laſt office to <hi>Lidias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At this word the teares hindered her voyce, that ſhe was conſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to hold her peace, but with ſuch demonſtration of diſpleaſure, that <hi>Clidaman</hi> was mooued, and to comfort her, ſaid: You are not (ſaid he) couragious: <hi>Melandre</hi> ſo to loſe your courage, that you may not maintaine that generouſneſſe in this accident, which you haue ſhewed in all the reſt; that God which hath preſerued you in ſo great perills, will not forſake you in the leſſer: You are to beleeue, that what may depend on me, ſhall be alwayes diſpoſed of to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment. But for that I am vnder a Prince whom I may not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe, your libertie muſt come from him, yet doe I promiſe you for my part whatſoeuer you may hope from a good friend.</p>
                  <p>And ſo leauing her with theſe good words, hee went to ſeeke out <hi>Childericke,</hi> and beſought him to procure of King <hi>Meroue</hi> the liberty of this young priſoner. The young Prince who loued my ſonne, and who knew well how willing the King his father would be to oblige <hi>Clidaman,</hi> without longer ſtay went to demaund it of <hi>Meroue,</hi> who graunted what his ſonne asked. And becauſe the time was ſo ſhort, that the leaſt part of it loſt, would hurt <hi>Melandre,</hi> hee went to ſeeke her at her Lodging; where hauing led her aſide, he ſaid:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:177519:208"/>
Sad Knight (quoth he) you muſt change that name, for if your mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes haue heretofore giuen you cauſe to beare it, it ſeemes you ſhall ſhortly looſe it. The Heauens begin to looke on you with a more pleaſing eye then of wont. And as one euill comes not alone, ſo good fortunes march alwayes in companies: and for proofe of that I ſay, know Knight (for ſo your will is I ſhould call you, ſince your generouſneſſe hath of good right wonne you that Title) that henceforth you are at liberty, and may diſpoſe of your actions as you pleaſe. The Prince of the <hi>Franks</hi> hath giuen mee leaue to diſpoſe of you, and the dutie of a Knight binds me not onely to ſet you at liberty, but to offer you all the aſſiſtance that you thinke I may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foord you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Melandre</hi> hearing a word ſo vnhoped for, leaped with ioy, and caſting her ſelfe at his feet, kiſſed his hand by way of thankes for ſo great a grace: for the good which ſhee imagined to receiue from him, was to be put to a ranſome; and the inconueniences of paying it, made her deſpayre of being able to doe it ſo ſoone as the terme of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene dayes were run out. But when ſhee heard ſo great courteſie: Truly ſaid ſhe to him, Sir Knight, you make it appeare, that you know what it is to loue, ſince you haue pittie on them that are taynted with it. I pray God, vntill my ſelfe be able to requite it, that hee would make you as happy as hee hath made you courteous and worthie of all good fortune: and at that very houre ſhee would haue beene gone; which <hi>Clidaman</hi> would not ſuffer, becauſe it was night.</p>
                  <p>The next morning then very early ſhe ſet on her way, and ſtayed not till ſhe came to <hi>Callais,</hi> where by chance ſhe arriued the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the terme. That euening ſhe would haue made her comming knowne to <hi>Lipandas,</hi> had ſhee not beene of the minde, conſidering the perfidiouſneſſe of him with whom ſhee had to doe, to attend for the day, that the more perſons might ſee the wrong hee did her, if haply hee ſhould be fayling of his word.</p>
                  <p>The day being come, and the houre of Mid-day hauing ſtrucke, that the chiefe men of the place, to honour the Gouernour, were then in his houſe; behold the ſad Knight preſenting himſelfe, at the firſt hee was not knowne, for they had not ſeene him but in Combate, where it may be feare had altered his countenance: and then euery man drew neere to heare what hee would ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lipandas,</hi> ſaid he, I come hither in the behalfe of the kinſmen and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:177519:208"/>
friends of <hi>Lidias,</hi> to heare ſome newes of him, and to charge you with your word, or to referre him to ſome other new condition: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they ſend you word by me, that they will proclay me you for an vnhoneſt man.</p>
                  <p>Stranger, anſwered <hi>Lipandas,</hi> you may tell them that <hi>Lidias</hi> fares better then he ſhall doe within few dayes, becauſe that this day being paſt, I will deliuer him into the hands of them that will auenge me: that for my word I thinke I am quit, in giuing him ouer into the hands of luſtice; for this Iuſtice, what other thing is it, but true Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie? As for the new conditions, I will haue no other but that which I haue already propounded, which is, that they put into my hands him that fought againſt me, that I may doe my will of him, and I will deliuer <hi>Lidias.</hi> And what is that, ſaid he, that you will doe? When I am to giue account of my actions to you, anſwered hee, you ſhall know. And how, ſaid he, are you yet of the ſame mind? Altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſame mind, replyed <hi>Lipandas.</hi> If it be ſo, added the ſad Knight, ſend for <hi>Lidias,</hi> and I will deliuer you him whom you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund. <hi>Lipandas,</hi> that aboue all things deſired to be reuenged of his enemie, for he had turned all his hatred on <hi>Melandre,</hi> ſent for him immediately. <hi>Lidias,</hi> that knew well, that that day was the laſt of the terme which he had ſet, beleeued it was to lead him to the Lords of Iuſtice: notwithſtanding hee fore-ſaw his aſſured death, yet did hee chuſe it, rather then to ſee him that had fought for him, in that danger for his ſake. When hee was come before <hi>Lipandas,</hi> hee ſaid; <hi>Lidias,</hi> ſee the laſt day that I haue giuen thee to preſent thy Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into my hands; this young Knight is come hither for that cauſe, if he doe it, thou art at liberty. <hi>Melandre,</hi> while thoſe few words were ſpeaking, found the meanes to turne her face aſide, that ſhee might not be knowne; and when ſhee would anſwer, ſhee turned wholly towards <hi>Lipandas,</hi> and ſaid: Yes <hi>Lipandas,</hi> I haue promiſed, and I will doe it. Doe you keepe your word as well, for I am hee whom you demaund; behold me that feare neither rigour nor cruelty whatſoeuer, prouided that my friend be freed from paine. Then euery one caſt his eyes on her, and calling to memory the faſhion of him that combated, knew ſhe ſayd true. Her beauty, her youth, and her affection mooued all them that were preſent, except <hi>Lipandas,</hi> who thought himſelf infinitely offended with h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r, commanded ſhe ſhould preſently bee put in priſon, and ſuffered <hi>Lidias</hi> to goe at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:177519:209"/>
Hee that deſired rather his owne deſtruction, then to ſee himſelfe ſo much obliged, made ſome difficultie. But <hi>Melandre</hi> came toward him, and told him in his care: <hi>Lidias</hi> be gone, trouble not your ſelfe for me, I haue a meane to get out of priſon very eaſily when I will: and if you will doe any thing for me, I pray you goe ſerue <hi>Meroue,</hi> and particularly <hi>Clidaman,</hi> who is the cauſe that you are at liberty, and tell him, that it is for my ſake that you came to him.</p>
                  <p>And is it poſſible, ſaid <hi>Lidias,</hi> that I ſhould goe, before I know who you are? I am, anſwered ſhe, the ſad Knight: and this ſhall ſuffice, till you haue better opportunitie to know more. So went <hi>Lidias</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, with a reſolution to ſerue the King of the <hi>Franks,</hi> ſince hee to whom hee twice ought his life, would haue it ſo.</p>
                  <p>But in the meane time <hi>Lipandas</hi> expreſſely commaunded, that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landre</hi> ſhould be well guarded, and put her into a Denne, with yrons on her hands and feet, reſoluing to let her lye there, till ſhee dyed through miſerie. Iudge in what caſe this young maid was, and what complaints ſhe might make againſt Loue: Her food was vile, and her lodging fearefull, and all other diſcommodities great, that if her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection had not ſupported theſe things, it is impoſſible but ſhee muſt haue dyed.</p>
                  <p>But in the meane time the rumor ſpred throughout all <hi>Normandy,</hi> that <hi>Lidias</hi> by the meanes of his friend was deliuered from the priſon at <hi>Callais,</hi> and that he was gone to ſerue the King <hi>Meroue,</hi> this was the cauſe that his baniſhment was renewed, and he declared Traytor to his Countrey. Yet hee forbare not to come to the Campe of the <hi>Franks:</hi> where ſearching for the Tent of <hi>Clidaman,</hi> it was ſhewed him. As ſoone as he ſaw it, and that <hi>Lindamor</hi> and <hi>Guymantes</hi> ſpyed him, they ran to embrace him, but with ſuch affection and ſuch cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie, that he was aſtonied; for they all tooke him for <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> that a little before was loſt in the battaile which they had againſt the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> whom he ſo much reſembled, that all they that knew <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> were deceiued.</p>
                  <p>In the end being knowne to be <hi>Lidias,</hi> the friend of <hi>Melandre,</hi> he led him to <hi>Meroue:</hi> where, in the preſence of them all, <hi>Lidias</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed to the King the ſtory of his priſon as you haue heard, and the courteſie which he had twice receiued of that vnknowne Knight, and at laſt, the commaundement which hee gaue him to come and ſerue him, and particularly <hi>Clidaman.</hi> Then <hi>Clidaman,</hi> after the King had entertained him, and thanked him for his loue, ſaid: Is it poſſible
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:177519:209"/>
                     <hi>Lidias,</hi> you know not him that fought, and is in priſon for you? No truely ſayd he. Behold ſayde hee, the ſtrangeſt miſtaking that I euer heard ſpoken of, haue you euer ſeene one reſemble him? Not as I remember<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſayd <hi>Lidias,</hi> all aſtoniſhed. Then will I tell the king (ſayd <hi>Clidaman)</hi> an hiſtory the moſt worthy of compaſſion that euer loue wrought: And thereupon hee began the diſcourſe which <hi>Lidias</hi> had told, that he went into great <hi>Brittaine,</hi> of the contents he found there, whereto he adioyned very diſcreetly the loue of <hi>Melandre,</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he made, of the carrying her into <hi>Normandie</hi> with him if he were conſtrained to goe; of his flight: and laſtly, of his impriſonment at <hi>Callais.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The poore <hi>Lidias</hi> was ſo aſtoniſhed, to heare ſuch particularities of his life, that he knew not what to thinke. But when <hi>Clidaman</hi> repeated to him the reſolution of <hi>Melandre</hi> to ſet on her voyage, and her attiring her ſelfe like a man, to giue his friends knowledge of it, and after to arme and enter in cloſe field againſt <hi>Lipandas,</hi> and the fortunes of the two combats; there was not one of the hearers that was not rauiſhed, and much more when he ended all that which I haue tolde you. O Gods, cryed out <hi>Lidias,</hi> is it poſſible that mine eyes haue beene ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded? what is there for mee to doe, to free my ſelfe of this obligation? There is nothing more, ſayde <hi>Clydaman,</hi> then to hazard for her that which ſhe hath preſerued in you. That added <hi>Lidias</hi> with a deepe ſigh, me thinks it is but a ſmall thing, if the intire affection which ſhe beares me, be accompanyed with mine owne. In the meane time that they had this diſcourſe, they which heard <hi>Clidaman,</hi> ſaid, that this maid alone deſerued to haue this great Army to aſſaile <hi>Callais.</hi> In truth, ſayde <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roue,</hi> I will neglect all other things rather then not get the libertie to a Lady ſo vertuous, and wee know not how our armes may bee better employed then in ſuch ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>The euening being come, <hi>Lidias</hi> goeth to <hi>Clidaman,</hi> and diſcouers to him that hee had an infallible enterpriſe on <hi>Callais,</hi> which hee had noted during the time hee was priſoner, that if they would giue him ſouldiers, without doubt he would put them into the towne. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice being reported to <hi>Meroue,</hi> it was found ſo good, that he reſolued to ſend him So there were giuen him fiue hundred archers conducted by two hundred men at armes, to execute this enterpriſe. The conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was (for I cannot tell you all the buſineſſe) <hi>Callais</hi> was taken, <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pandas</hi> priſoner, and <hi>Melandre</hi> freed out of captiuitie. But I know not how nor why; hardly was the tumult of the taken town ceaſed, but it
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:177519:210"/>
was noted, that <hi>Lidias</hi> and <hi>Melandre</hi> were gone, ſo that ſince is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne what is become of them.</p>
                  <p>Now during all theſe things, the poore <hi>Ligdamon</hi> hath been more tormented for <hi>Lidias,</hi> then may well be told: for being priſoner in the hands of the <hi>Normans,</hi> he was taken for <hi>Lidias,</hi> and as ſoone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to death. <hi>Clidaman</hi> ſo wrought, that <hi>Meroue</hi> ſent them two Heralds at Armes, to let them know how they deceiued themſelues: but the aſſurance which <hi>Lipandas</hi> had newly giuen them, made them paſſe it ouer, without giuing credit to <hi>Meroue.</hi> So behold <hi>Ligdamon</hi> put into the Cage of the Lyons, where it is ſaid hee did more then a man might doe: but without doubt he had dyed, had it not been that a very faire Lady had demaunded him for Husband. The cuſtome which permits it to be ſo, ſaued him for that time, but ſhortly after hee dyed: for louing <hi>Siluy</hi> with ſuch an affection, that it would not ſuffer him to marry any other then her, hee rather made choiſe of a Tombe, then that faire Dame: ſo that when they would marry him, he poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelfe; and ſhe that beleeued it was indeed <hi>Lidias,</hi> who hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had loued her ſo dearely, poyſoned her ſelfe alſo with the ſame potion. So is the poore <hi>Ligdamon</hi> dead, with ſuch lamentation of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, that there is none among his enemies, but bewayles him. But that is a gracious reuenge wherewith Loue hath puniſhed the cruell <hi>Lipandas:</hi> for calling to his remembrance the vertue, the beautie, and the affection of <hi>Melandre,</hi> he is become ſo farre in loue with her, that poore as hee is, hee takes no conſolation but in ſpeaking of her. My ſonne ſends me word, that he doth what he can to get him out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and that he hopes to obtaine it.</p>
                  <p>So (continued <hi>Amaſis)</hi> now they liue with ſuch honour and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations, that euery man eſteemes more of them then any other in the Army. I pray God, ſaid <hi>Adamas,</hi> to continue them ſtill in ſuch good fortune.</p>
                  <p>And while they diſcourſed thus, they ſaw comming along <hi>Leonide</hi> and <hi>Lucinde,</hi> with the little <hi>Merill:</hi> I ſay <hi>Lucinde,</hi> becauſe <hi>Celadon,</hi> as I told you, bare that name, following the reſolution which <hi>Galathee</hi> had made. <hi>Amaſis</hi> that knew her not, asked who ſhe was.

At this word, <hi>Leonide</hi> came ſo neere, that <hi>Lucinde</hi> to kiſſe the hand of <hi>Amaſis,</hi> aduanced forward, and ſetting one knee on the ground, kiſſed her hand with a faſhion ſo well counterfeited, that there was none but tooke her for a maid. <hi>Amaſis</hi> rayſed her vp, and after ſhe had embraced her, ſhe kiſſed her, telling her, that ſhe loued <hi>Adamas</hi> ſo well, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer touched him, was deare to her as her owne children. Then <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damas</hi> tooke the word by the end, for feare, that if the fained <hi>Lucinde</hi> ſhould anſwer, they might find out ſomewhat by her voice. But hee needed not haue feared: for ſhe knew ſo well to counterfeit, that her voyce as well as the reſt would haue helped the better to make vp the deceit. Yet for this blow, ſhee contented her ſelfe to allow of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of <hi>Adamas</hi> onely with a low courteſie; and after drew backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other Nymphs, attending for nothing but ſome opportunity to ſteale away.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, the houre of dinner being come, <hi>Amaſis</hi> returned to her Lodging: where finding the Tables ready ſpred, euery one full of contentment for the good newes they had, dined cheerefully, except <hi>Siluy,</hi> who had alwayes before her eyes the image of her deare <hi>Ligdamon,</hi> and in her ſoule the remembrance that he dyed for her. This was the ſubiect wherewith they ſpent one part of the dinner: for the Nymph was willing ynough they ſhould know that ſhe loued the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a man both vertuous and ſo dedicated to her; but withall, that being dead, ſhe ſhould be no more importuned by him, nor he benefit himſelfe with this good will.</p>
                  <p>After dinner, all the Nymphs diſpoſed themſelues, ſome to play, other to ſee the Houſe, ſome the Garden, others to entertaine the time with diuerſe diſcourſes in the chamber of <hi>Amaſis. Leonide,</hi> without the heeding of any, making ſhew to prepare her ſelfe for the iourney, got out of the chamber, and ſhortly after <hi>Lucinde,</hi> and meeting at the <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuous</hi> that was giuen them, fayning to go walke, went out of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, hauing hid vnder their ſleeues eyther of them a part of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards garments: and when they were at the Woods end, the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard vnclothed himſelfe, and taking his accuſtomed habite, thanked the Nymph for the great helpe ſhe had giuen him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and offered in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change his life, and all that depended on it Then the Nymph with a great ſigh ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

(ſaid ſhe) then remember what you haue ſworne to me: for I am reſolued now to bring it into proofe. Faire Nymph, anſwered <hi>Cela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> diſpoſe of all that I may, as of that which your ſelfe may, for you ſhall be no better obeyed of your ſelfe then of me. Haue you not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, replyed the Nymph, that I ſhould inquire into your life paſſed; and that which I could find you might doe for me, you would doe it? and hee anſwering it was true. Well <hi>Celadon,</hi> continued ſhe, I haue done that which you willed me; and though they paint Loue blind, yet hath it left me light ynough to know, that truely you are to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the loue which you haue ſo often promiſed to be eternall to your <hi>Aſtrea;</hi> for the preciſeneſſe of Loue will not permit a man to be either for ſworne or vnfaithfull. And ſo though one haue vſed you hardly, yet muſt not you fayle in your dutie; for another mans error will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer waſh away our fault. Then loue the faire and happy <hi>Aſtrea</hi> with as much affection and ſinceritie as you euer loued her, ſerue her, adore her, and more, if more may be, for Loue will haue extremity in his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice: but withall I well know, that the good offices which I haue done you, deſerue ſome remembrance of you: and without doubt, becauſe Loue cannot pay it ſelfe but by Loue, you ſhall be obliged to ſatisfie me in the ſame money, if the impoſſibilitie contradicted it not. But ſince it is true, that one heart is capable but of one true loue, I muſt pay my ſelfe of that which remaynes. Then hauing no more Loues to giue me as to a Miſtris, I demaund your amitie as your ſiſter, and from henceforth you loue me, you cheriſh me, and hold me for ſuch. The contentment of <hi>Celadon,</hi> hearing theſe words, cannot be expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; for he proteſted, that that was one of the things which in his miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie he found ſome kind of contentment in. Therefore, after hee had thanked the Nymph for the amitie ſhe bare him, he ſwore vnto her to take her for his ſiſter, and neuer to vſe her but as that name commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him. Then leſt they ſhould be found out, they ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, both well contented and ſatisfied each with other.</p>

The humor of this vnknowne ſhepheard, ſimpathi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with his owne, made him curious to know of him ſome newes of his miſtreſſe, thinking he could not learne it more eaſily by another, without being knowne. Then approaching to him, he ſayd. Shepheard God giue thee the contentment which thou wiſheth for, as I deſire with a good heart, and not being able to do more, thou art to take it in good part: and if it may binde thee to any touch of curteſie, tell me I beſeech thee if thou knoweſt <hi>Astrea, Phillis</hi> and <hi>Licides,</hi> and if ſo, declare to me what thou knoweſt, Gentle ſhepheard, anſwered hee, thy courteous words binde mee to pray heauen, in exchange of that thou wiſheth mee, that it neuer giue thee occaſion to bewayle that I mourne for: and moreouer, to tell all I know of the perſons whom thou ſpeakeſt of, though the ſadnes wherein I liue, forbid me to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in other affaires then mine owne. It may be abouts month and an halfe ſince, I came into the countrey of <hi>Forreſts,</hi> not as did many, to try the fountaine of the veritie of Loue. For I am but too well aſſured of my euill, but following the commandement of a God, which from the flowry bankes of that glorious <hi>Seyne,</hi> hath ſent me hither with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance that I ſhall finde remedy for my diſpleaſure. And ſince, my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in theſe villages ſeemed ſo pleaſing and agreeing to my humor, that I reſolued to tarry as long as the heauens would permit me. That purpoſe made me deſirous to know the being, and the quality of the moſt part of the ſhepheards and ſhepheardeſſes of that countrey; and becauſe they, of whom you demanded newes, are the principalleſt of that hamlet, which is beyond the water where I made choice to abide, I can tell you as much as you deſire.

At laſt and that is the more common opinion, becauſe <hi>Phillis, Aſtrea,</hi> and <hi>Licidas</hi> themſelues told it ſo, being layd to ſleepe on the riuers banke, he muſt needs fall in, and indeede the faire <hi>Aſtrea</hi> did the like, but her cloathes ſaued her. <hi>Celadon</hi> then iudged that they three had wiſely found this inuention, leſt they might giue occaſion to many to ſpeake ſome euill of it, and was well pleaſed: for hee had alwayes feare that they would ſuſpect ſomewhat to the diſgrace of <hi>Astrea,</hi> and therefore holding on his demands: But ſayd he, what thinke they is become of him? That he is dead, anſwered the deſolate ſhepheard, and aſſure your ſelfe that <hi>Astrea</hi> carries, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer ſhe diſſemble, ſuch a loade of griefe, that it is incredible how much they ſay ſhe is changed. Yet as it is, if <hi>Diana</hi> be not a let, ſhee is the fayreſt of all thoſe that euer I ſaw, my deare <hi>Cleon</hi> excepted, but thoſe three may goe ioyntly. Euery other man (added <hi>Celadon)</hi> will ſay as much of his miſtreſſe, for Loue hath this property, not to ſhut vp the eyes as ſome beleeue, but to change the eyes of them that loue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the loue it ſelfe, and for that there were neuer ſoule loues, neuer ſhall a louer finde his miſtreſſe foule.</p>
                  <p>That, anſwered the ſhepheard, would haue ſerued well, if I had lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Aſtrea</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> but being not capable of it, I am a iudge without exception. And you that doubt of the beautie of theſe two ſhephear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſes, are you a ſtranger, or doth hatred make you commit an error ſo contrary to that which you ſay proceeds from loue?</p>
                  <p>I am neither of them, ſayd <hi>Celadon,</hi> but indeede the moſt miſerable and moſt afflicted ſhepheard in the world. That wil I neuer yeeld to, vnleſſe you put me out of the number: for if your euill come from any
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:177519:214"/>
other thing then loue, your ſtripes are not ſo grieuous as mine, for that the hart being the moſt ſenſible part we haue, we feel more to the quick the offences of it. But if your euill proceede of loue, yet muſt it giue place to mine, ſince of all the euils of loue, there is none like to that which hath no hope, hauing heard ſay long agoe, where hope may onely licke the ſore, it is not ouer grieuous. Now this hope may min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle it ſelfe in all thoſe accidents of loue, be it diſdaine, be it anger, bee it iealouſie, be it abſence; except where death takes place (For that pale goddes with her fatall hand cuts off hope at one blow, when the thred of life is broken.) But I more miſerable then all others, moſt miſerable I go bewayling an euill without remedy and without hope. <hi>Celadon</hi> then anſwered him with a great ſigh, Shepheard how are you decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in your opinion? I will confeſſe that the greateſt euils are thoſe of loue, thereof I am too faithfull a witneſſe: but to ſay, that they that are without hope are the moſt grieuous, ſo farre is it that they meri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And loue, what is it (anſwered hee) but a purefolly. I will not, replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> enter now into that diſcourſe, becauſe I would finiſh the former. But tell me, bewayle you this death for loue or no? It is (anſwered he) for loue. Now what is this loue, fayd <hi>Celadon,</hi> but as I haue heard it ſayd of <hi>Siluander,</hi> and the moſt vnderſtanding of our ſhepheards, but a deſire of the beautie, which we finde to be ſuch. It is true, ſayd the ſtranger. But replyed <hi>Celadon,</hi> is this a thing in a man reaſonable, to deſire a thing he cannot haue? No certainly (ſayd hee.) Now you may ſee, ſayd <hi>Celadon,</hi> how the death of <hi>Cleon</hi> ought to bee the remedy of your euills, for ſince you confeſſe, that deſire ought not to be where hope cannot reach, and that loue is nothing but deſire, death which by that which you ſay, depriues you of all hope, ſhould by conſequent put from you all deſire; and deſire dying, it ſhould draw away loue into ſame coffin, and hauing no more of loue, ſince the euill you complained of is fallen, I know not how you can feele it.</p>
                  <p>The deſolate ſhepheard anſwered; Be it loue or hatred, ſo it is, that it is truer then I can tell you, that my euill is moſt extreme. And for that <hi>Celadon</hi> would haue replyed, hee that could not abide to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted in that opinion, thinking that if hee endured to heare the contrary reaſons, he ſhould offend the aſhes of <hi>Cleon,</hi> ſaide ſhepheard; that which is vnder <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

that I feele. And thereupon commends him to <hi>Pan</hi> and takes another way, and <hi>Celadon</hi> likewiſe paſſeth ouer the riuer: and becauſe ſolitude hath this propertie, to repreſent moſt liuely either ioy or ſadneſſe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, he beganne to be ſo handled for the time by his fortune and loue, that he had no cauſe of torment in him, which was not before his eyes. He was exempted onely of iealouſie, yet with ſuch ſorrowes, that if that monſter had taken hold on him, I know not what armie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

In theſe ſad thoughts holding on his pace, hee found the bridge, ouer which being paſſed, hee went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the riuer, not knowing which way to take, for in any caſe hee would obey the commandement of <hi>Aſtrea,</hi> who had forbid him to come in her ſight vntill ſhe bad him. At laſt being come neare <hi>Boulieu</hi> inhabited by the veſtals, hee was as ſurpriſed with ſhame for comming ſo neare vnwares, from whence his reſolution commanded him to go, and minding to turne, he thruſt into a wood ſo large, and in ſome pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

By fortune, being weary of the long way, he went about ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a place wherein he might reſt, attending till the night might giue him leaue to withdraw himſelfe without meeting of any body, purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to go ſo far where they might neuer heare news of him: he caſt his eye on a caue, which on the ſide of the entry was waſhed by the riuer, and on the other ſide was halfe couered with ſome trees and buſhes, which by their thickneſſe tooke the ſight of him from them that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed along that way, and he himſelfe had not heeded it, had it not been that being conſtrayned to paſſe along the Riuer, hee found himſelfe before the entry; whither by fortune being got vp, and thinking hee might there be well hidden till night, the place pleaſed him ſo well, that he reſolued to paſſe the reſt of his ſorrowfull and diſaſterous dayes there, hauing a purpoſe all the day long not to goe from the hollow of that Caue. In this de liberation he beganne to trimme it the beſt he could, ſweeping out all the rubbiſh which the riuer, being great, had brought in. It was nothing but a little rocke, which the water being ſtrong had made hollow by little and little, and that with great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:177519:215"/>
long, and becauſe it was round, it had the greater bredth. It was a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle higher then a man; yet in ſome places there hung downe ſome points of the Rocke, which the ſhepheard, by throwing grauell ſtones at it, by little and little broke off: and becauſe by chance it was found hardeſt at the bottome, the water had not made it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Being in ſhort time fitted in this manner, he put off his Coat and his Wallet, and other Weeds which troubled him moſt, and tying them together, layed them on the bed with his Pipe, which alwayes he bare in faſhion of a Scarfe: but ſtripping himſelfe, by chance there fell a paper on the ground, which he knew full well to come from the faire <hi>Aſtrea.</hi> This remembrance being hindered by nothing which might draw him other where (for nothing was preſented to his eyes but the courſe of the Riuer) had ſuch power ouer him, that there was no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble befallen him ſince his baniſhment, that came not into his memory. At laſt rayſing himſelfe from theſe thoughts as from a ſound ſleepe, hee came to the doore of the Caue, where vnfolding the deare Paper which he had in his hand, after a thouſand ardent and amorous kiſſes, he ſaid: Ah deare Paper, heretofore the cauſe of my contentment, and now the occaſion of renewing my ſorrowes, how is it poſſible, that you ſhould keepe in you the conceit of her that writ you, without changing it, ſince the good will, which then was there, is ſo changed, that ſhe and I are no more that we were wont to be? Oh what fault is this? A thing without ſpirit is conſtant, and the moſt faire of ſpirits is not ſo. At this word hauing opened it, the firſt thing that preſented it ſelfe, was the cypher of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> ioyned with his owne. This put him in minde of his happineſſe paſſed ſo liuely in his ſpirit, that the griefe to ſee himſelfe ſo fallen, almoſt brought him to the terme of deſpayre.

At this word hee ſat downe on a great ſtone which hee had drawne from the Riuer to the entry of his Denne, and after he had wiped away his teares, he red the Letter, which was thus.</p>

                  <p>Now twice had the day giuen place to the night, before this ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard remembred to eate, for his ſad thoughts buſied him ſo, and the melancholy ſo filld his ſtomacke, that he had no appetite to other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals then that which the remembrance of his ſorrowes could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare, ſoftened with ſo many teares, that his eyes ſeemed two heads of Fountaines: and had it not beene for feare of offending the Gods in

ſuffering his owne death, and much rather, that of looſing by his death that faire Idea which hee had of <hi>Aſtrea</hi> in his heart, without doubt he would haue beene glad ſo to end the ſad courſe of his life. But ſeeing himſelfe ſo reſtrayned, he goes to the Wallet, which <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nide</hi> had well furniſhed, the prouiſion whereof laſted him many dayes, for he did eate as little as he could. At laſt, he was forced to runne to hearbes, and to the rootes that were moſt tender. He found not farre off a Fountaine, which abounded with Water-Creſſes, which was his moſt certaine and delicious foode: for knowing where to finde that with which he might liue, he employed his time but on his ſad thoughts, and they gaue him ſo faithfull companie, that as they could not be without him, ſo no more could he be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them.</p>
                  <p>So long as the day laſted, if he ſaw no body about his little Lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, he would walke along on the grauell, and there he often engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued on the tender barkes of young Trees the ſubiect of his ſorrowes, ſometimes his cypher and <hi>Aſtreas,</hi> and when hee alighted on them interlaced together, ſuddenly he would deface them, and ſay, Thou deceiueſt thy ſelfe <hi>Celadon,</hi> this is no more the ſeaſon that theſe cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers were allowed thee: The more conſtant thou art, the more to thy diſaduantage are all things changed. Deface, deface miſerable man, that ouer-happie teſtimonie of thy good time paſſed: and if thou wilt ſet downe with thy cypher that which pleaſes her moſt, ſet downe thy marke of teares, of paines, and of death.</p>
                  <p>With ſuch ſpeeches <hi>Celadon</hi> reprehended himſelfe, if at any time he forget<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> himſelfe in his thoughts. But when the night comes, it is then that all his diſpleaſures touch him to the quicke in his memory: for darkeneſſe hath this propertie, that it makes the imagination more ſtrong. Moreouer, he neuer returned home but when it was farre night: if the Moone ſhone, he paſſed the night vnder ſome Trees; where often ouercome with ſleepe before he was aware, he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe the next morning.</p>
                  <p>So went this ſad Shepheard drawing on his life, which in few dayes made him ſo pale and leane, that one might hardly know him: and himſelfe ſometimes going to drinke at the next Fountaine, was aſtonied, when hee ſaw his Figure in the Water, as beeing brought to that paſſe, that hee could not long liue. His beard could not make him looke grimme, for hee had none as yet: but

his hayre, which was much growne; the leaneneſſe, which had chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the roundeneſſe of his face, and made his noſe long; and ſadneſſe, which had driuen out of his eyes that liuely brightneſſe, which at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times had made him ſo gracious; now made him become quite other then he was wont to be. Ah, if <hi>Aſtrea</hi> had ſeene him in that caſe, what ioy and contentment would the paine of that faithfull Shepheard haue giuen her, knowing by ſo aſſured a teſtimonie, how truly ſhe was beloued of the moſt faithfull and moſt perfect Shepheard of <hi>Lig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
